  <div class="entry-content"><p>We tend to forget how huge China is. Yeah, China is big and there are many Chinese. But how <em>many</em> Chinese there are, just needs a reminder from time to time.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+china+vs+eu">Wolfram Alpha</a>, the population of china was estimated to be 1.3 billion in 2010. That is easily more, than the population of the EU and the USA combined.</p>

<p>This has a some peculiar consequences. For once, there are quite a few multi-million citizen cities, you&#8217;ve likely never heard of before. Would you know, where to search for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoukou">Zhoukou</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linyi">Linyi</a> on the map? They both have a population of around 10 Million - give or take.</p>

<p>Another interesting consequence, there are a lots of hugely popular services and companies, that you have also probably never heard of - some of them more interesting than others.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> equivalent of China for example is <a href="http://weibo.com">Sina Weibo</a>. While being mostly unknown in the western world, Weibo is about the same size as Twitter. According to the wikipedia, Twitter has currently about 500 million users and generates about 340 million messages a day. The 3 year old Weibo currently has about 368 million users and generates 100 million messages a day - not as much but the same order of magnitude (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">source</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo">source</a>).</p>

<p>Just as Weibo is quite similar to Twitter, there are many other china-only competitors to the services, we know. Yesterday, we used a very neat one. The site is called <a href="http://www.360buy.com/">360buy.com</a> (Strangely, many of the Chinese alternatives use .com instead of .cn TLDs). From the looks of it, they appear to be a competitor to <a href="http://www.amazon.de/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;site-redirect=de&amp;tag=notadomaincom-21">amazon</a>. Yet, 360buy has a cool feature: In many areas, including Beijing, they offer <em>same-day-delivery</em>. For free. Just like that.</p>

<p>We decided, we needed to get a cheep DVD player for the TV in our apartment. We went to 360buy, used Chrome to translate the page, chose a device, entered our address and clicked on order. This was around 9:00 am. The same day at around 5:00 pm, it knocked on the door. We payed in cash and got our DVD player.</p>

<p>The whole experience was fast, friendly and due to Chromes page translate-feature, even possible for lazy aliens, that don&#8217;t speak Chinese.</p>

<p>Part of me wants that from amazon <em>(in Germany)</em>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of course china uses money like everywhere else. And a lot of payments are done using cash. But the cash here is a bit different than in Europe.</p>

<p>This mainly boils down to the fact, that the biggest bill available in china is the 100 RMB bill. This is currently worth roughly 12.50 €. All other bills are worth even less. Also, coins are used far less often and only go up to 1 RMB (about 0.12 €).</p>

<p>This has two interesting consequences. First: You always have a trousers pocket full of papermoney. A thick stack of bills which is worth about 10 €. I kind of like that. Far more comfy than having a pocket full of €-coins. And still worth so little, that you don&#8217;t really care if you lose a bill. (I guess this is similar in the US with their 1 $ bill).</p>

<p>The second consequence is, whenever you have to pay for something a bit more expensive, you deal with huge stacks of money. Making you feel a bit like a gangster in the first moment and making you wish, you had a counting machine the moment after that. (Counting machines are extremely common in china. Basically every cash register has one).</p>

<p>Did I mention, we payed our entire 3 month rent and a safety deposit in cash? This is how some of it looked:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i38xa6h39hlzyqn/Cash.jpg?dl=1" title="Lots of cash" ></p>

<p>Really, you have to deal with silly big stacks of cash from time to time. You have to make multiple trips to an ATM to get reasonable amounts of cash because they can&#8217;t spit out stacks big enough. Stuff like that.</p>

<p>Apparently there is also quite a lot of counterfeit money in the wild. The Chinese will always check 50 and 100 RMB bills for validity. Either by hand or by feeding it through a counting machine.</p>

<p>And there is also the other side of the value spectrum. The smallest bill in circulation (and not quite uncommon) is the 1 Yi Jiao bill, aka 0.1 RMB. So it is roughly worth 1 euro cent.</p>

<p>On the street, prices are usually multiples of 1 RMB. Amounts below 1 RMB are usually only found in supermarkets and similar stores. So you usually put your Yi Jiaos somewhere and hope to remember theme the next time you are grocery shopping.</p>

<p>This is how it looks:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/099yd7pqn7e6182/worthless.jpg?dl=1" title="Worthless money" ></p>

<p>It has roughly the same size and feel as monopoly money. Only, it is worth slightly less then monopoly money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Preface</h1>

<p>We&#8217;ve been in Beijing for over a month by now. After that time I feel quite confident in saying, that Beijing is just another big city. It is quite <em>western</em> and very big. If you look at it from a high enough level, it is very similar to other big cities. There is public transportation. People have jobs. There is a large middle class. People buy designer clothes in huge malls. Just the usual.</p>

<p>It is the same shit like home, albeit <em>some</em> things are different. If you zoom in close enough, you can see lots of small differences. In the way, the city works, the society works. Really, it&#8217;s all over the place. In the <em>Small Differences</em> series of posts, I plan to point out those differences, I found noticeable.</p>

<h1>Small Differences: Prepaid</h1>

<p>Having a prepaid cell phone is a very common thing here in Beijing like in many other big cities all around the globe. However, cell phones are not the only thing coming as prepaid variant over here. A few days ago, we had to find out, that also gas, water and electricity are often prepaid in China. And how do you discover something like that? Of course by standing under the shower and enjoying a lack of warm water. We complained to the landlord and low and behold - the next day someone came with a smart card, shoved it somewhere into the gas-meter and everything was fine again.</p>

<p>They also showed us the cards. This is a bit useless since we have no idea at all how to recharge those cards. But I can at least show them here. In order from top to bottom: Water, electricity and gas.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/147h19vten5i5c2/Prepaid.jpg?dl=1"></p>

<p>If you think about it, it actually isn&#8217;t that bad of an idea. At least people can&#8217;t get in situations, where they all of a sudden have to repay huge sums because they used more gas then anticipated.</p>

<p>I will write about heating here another time. There is a small difference to heating as well, although it is not prepaid like gas, water and electricity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks before we started our journey, a friend of mine gave me a
link to an article in the german Tagesspiegel (<a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/leben-in-china-dicke-luft-in-peking-/6848760.html">link</a>). The author of that article stayed a while in Beijing as well. And according to her, the quality of the air in Beijing is usually so bad,
it took the author over a week to realize that her apartment had a view
on the mountains.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Beijing, we had a clear blue sky. So naturally, I was
thinking the author exaggerated a bit. That is, until yesterday, when I
realized that our apartment had a view on the mountains as well. It took
us <em>just</em> five days to realize that.</p>

<p>I took a picture from our window that morning. Today – also a nice
day with lots of sun – I tried to take the same picutre again. Same ISO, same
aperture, same shutter speed, roughly the same time of the day. I merged those images. This is the result:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/e211rvp9v1fnn6s/Airquality.jpg?dl=1" title="Overlay of a clear and a usual day" ></p>

<p>To be honest, I made one mistake. I let the camera on
auto-white-balance. This probably overstates the difference a bit.
Anyways, take a deep breath and enjoy.</p>

         &bull; <a rel="bookmark" href="/blog/2012/10/08/elevator-rushhour/">&infin;</a>
      </p>
    
  </header>



  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning, we encountered something, I didn&#8217;t knew existed: <em>Elevator
Rushhour</em>. I&#8217;ve never lived in a 28 story building before. We now live
on the 21st floor. If every floor is roughly the same as ours, there are 12
apartments on each floor.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>=&gt; (* 28 12)
</span><span class='line'>; 336</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So there are a good 300 apartments. The building currently has three working elevators.
Even if we assume that not every
apartment is inhabited and not every inhabitant has to get up in
the morning to get to work, this leaves us with a lot of people that
need to exit the building in a narrow timeframe.</p>

<p>We left at 8:00. And we waited for nearly 10 minutes to finally leave the
building. The elevators were all basically stopping at every other floor
on their way down. Then going all the way up again only to repeat the
stop and go on their way down.</p>

<p>On thrusday, in just a few short days, we will start quite a big travel.
First stop will be Moscow, where we stay for a day before we head on to
lake baikal for a week of hiking and vacation.</p>

<p>Next stop will be china. <em>A.</em> will be doing an internship in Beijing
starting in October and I will give her company as long as I&#8217;m permitted
to stay in China. Sadly it is not possible to stay in China as a tourist
for as long as an intern.</p>

<p>When my permission to stay in China expires, we will have to part our
ways for a few weeks. I will move on to South Korea and Japan (and maybe
some more places where I don&#8217;t need a complicated visa).</p>

<p>At the end of december, we will rejoin at beijing airport to fly back
home together. Or at least that is the plan.</p>

<p>All of this is surely going to be very exciting and we are looking
forward to it a lot (although from time to time a bit nervously). Did I
mention, we don&#8217;t really speak any chinese language?</p>

<p>As a result of our travels, over the next few weeks and months, the focus of
this blog might shift a bit away from technical topics over to
documenting our travels.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;m not sure about the conditions of the intertube access along
the way, this might be more or less complicated. I might have trouble
posting to this blog, therefore I&#8217;ve also set up accounts over at
<a href="http://mo-gr.tumblr.com">tumblr</a> and <a href="http://mo-gr.posterous.com">posterous</a>.
And be sure to also follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mo_gr">twitter</a> if
you want to stay up to date.</p>

<p>We will post pictures and status updates to at least one of those places
in a semi regular fashion.</p>

  </header>



  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, <a href="mana">Matthias Naber</a> made me aware of <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> type hints in JSF and JSP files.</p>

<p><a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> does quite a good job in figuring out the types of EL variables itself, providing code completion and usage information. But there are situations where <a href="idea">IDEA</a> is unable determine the type of an EL variable. This usually occurs to me in a facelet <code>composition</code> where the variables are passed in as a <code>param</code>.</p>

<p>The following is a basic facelt composition invocation:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ui:include src="toiletten.xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;ui:param name="toilette" value="#{umkleide.toiletten}"/&gt;
&lt;/ui:include&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the file containing the invocation, <a href="idea">IDEA</a> is fully aware of the type of the EL variables. However in the included file (toiletten.xhtml), which might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html" 
  xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"&gt;
  &lt;ui:composition&gt;
    &lt;h:outputLabel value="#{toilette.ppBecken}"/&gt;
  &lt;/ui:composition&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> is unable to infere the type of the EL variable <code>toilette</code>. It is therefore neither able to offer me code completion nor warn me about typos and errors. It might even mark the getter <code>getPpBecken()</code> in the Toilette as unused.</p>

<p>However, if you help <a href="idea">IDEA</a> a little bit by hinting the type, all the goodness is restored. Just add the following, proprietary comment somewhere in the file:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;!--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This comment tells <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> the type of the EL variable, enabling autocompletion, usage indexing and of course only marking true errors in the file.</p>

<p>If you are using JSPs, the comment should probably look something like:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;%--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are somehow worried about putting proprietary comments in your files, <em>you</em> have some weird issues. But nonetheless, those comments, at least in facelets, even work outside of the <code>composition</code>-tag, which will make them become ignored anyway.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html" 
  xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"&gt;
  &lt;!--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--&gt;
  &lt;ui:composition&gt;
    &lt;h:outputLabel value="#{toilette.ppBecken}"/&gt;
  &lt;/ui:composition&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A properly configured <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> setup will help you so many times a day. You are going to be a <em>lot</em> more productive. It is absolutely worth, adding some comments and guides to make the warnings and analyzations of your IDE more precise and focussed.</p>

<p>If I had gotten a coin for every time, I fixed a bug, that was already underlined and critized by <a href="idea">IDEA</a> when I found it, I&#8217;d have an aweful lot of coins.</p>

<p>Use your tools to their full advance and don&#8217;t check in code that contains warnings! I really wish, there would be something like the <code>-Werror</code> flag in <code>javac</code>!</p>
