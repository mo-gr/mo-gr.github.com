      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I guess it&rsquo;s time to make it official:</p>

<h3>I am now a freelancer</h3>

<p>After years of constant employment, this is the first time I
am standing on my own two feet. I&rsquo;m still on the fence whether this is the
best decision or biggest mistake in my career so far.</p>

<p>I greatly enjoyed working at <a href="http://www.spree.de">akquinet</a> for the last
two and a half years. So, the decision to take this step was not an easy
one. But I just have to do this personal experiment. I don&rsquo;t want to
look back at my life later on and regret never having tried this. The
time is right and for the first few months I should be all set.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, here is some shameless self promotion: If you are looking for
an experienced technical consultant to maneuver your JVM based project
out of a tight corner – <a href="/about.html#contact">contact me</a>. If you are looking
for an excellent developer to help on your next kick-ass web application – <a href="/about.html#contact">contact me</a>.
If you need someone coaching your team to get up to speed on modern web
technologies – <a href="/about.html#contact">contact me</a>. And if you are actually looking for a highly
motivated clojure developer – please, please <a href="/about.html#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
