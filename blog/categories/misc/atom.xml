      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks before we started our journey, a friend of mine gave me a
link to an article in the german Tagesspiegel (<a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/leben-in-china-dicke-luft-in-peking-/6848760.html">link</a>). The author of that article stayed a while in Beijing as well. And according to her, the quality of the air in Beijing is usually so bad,
it took the author over a week to realize that her apartment had a view
on the mountains.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Beijing, we had a clear blue sky. So naturally, I was
thinking the author exaggerated a bit. That is, until yesterday, when I
realized that our apartment had a view on the mountains as well. It took
us <em>just</em> five days to realize that.</p>

<p>I took a picture from our window that morning. Today – also a nice
day with lots of sun – I tried to take the same picutre again. Same ISO, same
aperture, same shutter speed, roughly the same time of the day. I merged those images. This is the result:</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Airquality.jpg" title="Overlay of a clear and a usual day" ></p>

<p>To be honest, I made one mistake. I let the camera on
auto-white-balance. This probably overstates the difference a bit.
Anyways, take a deep breath and enjoy.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_madug76njY1rgtzh1o1_1280.jpg" title="'Ready to go on a tour'" ></p>

<p>On thrusday, in just a few short days, we will start quite a big travel.
First stop will be Moscow, where we stay for a day before we head on to
lake baikal for a week of hiking and vacation.</p>

<p>Next stop will be china. <em>A.</em> will be doing an internship in Beijing
starting in October and I will give her company as long as I'm permitted
to stay in China. Sadly it is not possible to stay in China as a tourist
for as long as an intern.</p>

<p>When my permission to stay in China expires, we will have to part our
ways for a few weeks. I will move on to South Korea and Japan (and maybe
some more places where I don't need a complicated visa).</p>

<p>At the end of december, we will rejoin at beijing airport to fly back
home together. Or at least that is the plan.</p>

<p>All of this is surely going to be very exciting and we are looking
forward to it a lot (although from time to time a bit nervously). Did I
mention, we don't really speak any chinese language?</p>

<p>As a result of our travels, over the next few weeks and months, the focus of
this blog might shift a bit away from technical topics over to
documenting our travels.</p>

<p>Since I'm not sure about the conditions of the intertube access along
the way, this might be more or less complicated. I might have trouble
posting to this blog, therefore I've also set up accounts over at
<a href="http://mo-gr.tumblr.com">tumblr</a> and <a href="http://mo-gr.posterous.com">posterous</a>.
And be sure to also follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mo_gr">twitter</a> if
you want to stay up to date.</p>

<p>We will post pictures and status updates to at least one of those places
in a semi regular fashion.</p>
