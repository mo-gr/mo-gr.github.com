<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/02/12/code-clouds</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I&#8217;ve been to <a href="http://jz11.java.no/news.html">Javazone</a> and among the many great speakers was
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kevlinhenney">Kevlin Henney</a>. His talk was titled <a href="http://vimeo.com/28772428">Cool Code</a> and if you havn&#8217;t seen it, I can highly recommend it! (same goes for all talks by Kevlin).</p>

<p>One of the things he mentioned in his talk were word clouds generated
from code to get a good overview of what a programm is about. They
provide no hard facts but a very intersting insight nonetheless. The
following is a word cloud generated from <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">hibernate-core</a> with the 100
most common words in the codebase. The bigger the word, the more common
it is.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.notadomain.com/images/hibernate-cloud.png" alt="Cloud of hibernate-core" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>On the first glance, one can see, that hibernate deals with lots of
Strings and takes a great deal of work to somehow handle null. Names and
sessions are important to hiberante as well and obviously, hiberante
also deals with transactions.</p>

<p>I really like this kind of visualization of code. It provides no hard facts but it can help detect code smells and project priorities. If <em>String</em> is very common, this might be a sign of an insufficient domain model. Maybe a few more classes should be introduced. Same goes for <em>Object</em>. In general, a code cloud should talk about the domain of the programm. About customers, orders and the like. It should not talk about implementation details like Strings or booleans. (Since <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">hibernate-core</a> is a general library, it might be ok, that transactions and sessions are not the primary words but Strings and Objects - although I somehow doubt it). Use code clouds as an additional datapoint, don&#8217;t rely to heavily on them and they might turn out to be a useful little tool in your analysis box.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://jz11.java.no/news.html">Javazone</a>, I
tried to create code clouds for the projects, I was working on. However I
couldn&#8217;t find a good tool. <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a> generates nice clouds, but it works
only online. I am not so comfortable with uploading my complete
codebase of customer projects to some website. So <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a> was out of
the game.
Apparently there were a few Windows tools, but I didn&#8217;t check them out.
But the idea of code clouds stuck with me.</p>

<p>Then a few days ago, I read a post on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a> about <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a> by
[Jason Davies]. <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a> is a layout plugin for the amazing JavaScript
data visualization engine <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a>. This was all I needed.</p>

<p>So I started playing around with it a bit and created <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Cloudserver">cloudserver</a>. The
above cloud of hibernate-core was created with it.</p>

<p>Since I wanted to get into <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a> anyway, this was a good start. And
if I am working in JavaScript anyway, why not try it in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>? And
if I am working in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>, why not just do it in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>?</p>

<p>So <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Cloudserver">cloudserver</a> got a bit of a playground of technologies. It is mostly
written in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. It reads in source files, cleans them up a
bit and counts each word. After it is done processing all files, it
brings them in a <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a>-friendly format and starts a local <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>
webserver. This server serves a small html file that contains the <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a>
bootstrap code and generates the cloud.</p>

<p>I tried to keep it mostly language agnostic with a pluggable system to
configure it to specific languages. Currenlty it only supports Java, but
it should be fairly easy to make langauge configurations for other
languages.</p>

<p>I have lots of ideas on how to improve <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Cloudserver">cloudserver</a>, like stripping
comments. And it is surely not bugfree. Since this is my
first contact with <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> and I am still not very mature in
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, I assume there are lots of rookie-mistakes lurking
around.</p>

<p>I plan to write up my impressions of <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> in
seperate posts.</p>

<p>If you used <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Cloudserver">cloudserver</a>, have questions or ideas, I would love to hear
from you! I would also love to show you some more clouds, but I
currently only have customer-projects with interesting code bases
around - and I am not comfortable with presenting them here.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>tl;dr: SSDs are awesome. Don&#8217;t have one? Get one!</em></p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/165601/blog/rocket.jpg" title="&#34;Picture completely unrelated to post - Happy new year&#34;" alt="&#34;Picture completely unrelated to post - Happy new year&#34;"></p>

<p>I got a late christmas gift in the form of a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004W2JL2A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=notadomaincom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2JL2A">Crucial M4 256G*</a> Solid State Drive. But let me start a bit earlier.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I wrote my diploma thesis on my trusty old Mid-2009 13&#8221; MacBook Pro. By far not the fastest machine even by Mid-2009 standards but fast enough for most of my needs most of the time. When I started at <a href="http://spree.de">akquinet</a> last year, they got me a 2.2 GHz i7 17&#8221; MacBook Pro and wow, that thing was fast! Especially compared to my old 13&#8221;. Even though the i7 was equipped with a traditional spinning disk hard disk, it felt way faster.</p>

<p>But I still use my 13&#8221; a lot and since everybody was singing the song of the SSD, I gut myself an <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B003NE5JCY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=notadomaincom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCY">OCZ Vertex 2*</a> to see what their tune was all about. And it was music… pure music. All of a sudden, the mighty i7 17&#8221; felt dead slow to me. It was like trying to ride on a dead horse. Where my aging 13&#8221; was snappy and responsive, the spinning disk in the 17&#8221; made it feel like it was heaving trouble getting up at all.</p>

<p>They say, the only people not recommending an SSD to you, are those, that don&#8217;t have one themself. This can&#8217;t be more true. Remember the old days of the late 90ies. When the best thing you could do to your computer was add more RAM. Always. Those days are over. Screw RAM. I have Gigs idling around all the time. Today the very best performance upgrade that money can buy is a solid state disk! Yes, they are expensive. More expensive than spinning disks. But they are worth every cent. 256 Gig SSDs are not absurdly expensive and they are a size that one can live with. Flush out all your huge files on to a big disk and live with the slight inconvenience of having to attach a USB drive when you want to watch that blue-ray rip. Once you&#8217;ve tasted the blood of an SSD you won&#8217;t go back!</p>

<p>Speaking of blood, I should probably mention one caveat. SSDs are not per se less reliable than spinning disks. But they apparently have a tendency to fail big time when they do fail. Think in terms of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html">oh-my-God-what-just-happened-to-all-my-data</a>. I&#8217;ll report when one of my SSDs has gone that way. Until then, Time Machine and myself will be good friends and seeing each other quite frequently.</p>

<p>By the way, I decided to start fresh with the new SSD and reinstalled Lion from scratch. Thanks to a rather fast internet connection, the cloud in general and iCloud in particular as well was a recent time machine backup, I&#8217;ve got my system from SSD-in-my-hand to ready-for-production-work in about 3 to 4 hours. This made me really appreciate the Mac App Store. In the time it took me to search for the licenses in my mails, I got all apps from the MAS ready to go with no interaction. Downloaded and licensed. No registration-key-copy-pasta. This was such a pleasant experience that I seriously consider purchasing MAS-Versions of the applications that I got pre-MAS that are available in the MAS by now.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michaelschuetz">Michael</a> and myself have been hacking some features into a specific version of <a href="http://www.jboss.org/picketlink">picketlink</a>. An update to a newer version was out of the question. We blogged about it over <a href="http://blog.akquinet.de/2011/12/26/patching-picketlink-to-support-multiple-ldap-stores/">here</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I really like to get my head around existing code bases. Finding my ways through them and fixing or modifing them. I should do that far more often!</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t want to rant too much about picketlink. It works most of the time. But man… there are some code smells in there. If I&#8217;m modifying a class somewhere down around line 3500-something, this is a smell. If a class needs more than 1000 LoC, it should probably not be a single class. DRY anyone? Enough of a rant… Our modifications aren&#8217;t really that much better. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_window_theory">Broken window theory</a> at work…</p>

<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/12/04/distraction-free-writing</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of fat, bloaty WYSIWYMG text editors. Some people call them word processors. Most of my longer texts in university have been written in LaTeX/vim. This also includes my diploma thesis. Every longer experience with the so called word processors made me hate them even more. I like the appeal of writing - and basically thinking - in plain text files. Having a confusing UI and lots of inconsistend formatting in the document is very annoying to me. But for everyday work, LaTeX is just too much of an overhead and, more often than not, feels arcane.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Recently, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber&#8217;s</a> markdown has sparked up everywhere. I really like it and since it is used in <a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress</a> I have to use it anyway. It basically solves the same problem, that LaTeX overengineers for me. It gives me a way to write plain text with some lightweight, natural markup for the occasional link or <em>emphasized</em> word. It is an awesome combo for most of the things I write.</p>

<p>And while I really like to use vim, especially the awesome <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>, all the bells and whistles of it feel a bit too much when all I want to do is write a simple blog post. Apprently I am not the only one, thinking like that. There are a few new texteditors that offer not much more than plain text editing. Probably the biggest two are <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a> and <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a>. I havn&#8217;t yet picked my personal favorite.</p>

<p>I like the inline-markdown preview/support of iA Writer and the iCloud support. But I am not so sure about the total lack of configurablility. iA Writer lets you configure nothing. WriteRoom lets you pick your own colors and fonts. I am using the Solarized Dark Theme from the Ethan Schoonovers <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized</a> project, which I am currently using about everywhere. It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111204-jyx7tgkg65ps8qm4pp6dg417x2.jpg"></p>

<p>A screenshot of iA makes no really sense as it always looks the same. Just head over to their <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">site</a> to see how it looks.</p>

<p>Since WriteRoom doesn&#8217;t support markdown, I use it in combination with <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, a simple markdown previewer. Marked doesn&#8217;t support all octopress extensions, but it is very lightweight and works well for basic previews. Another neat feature of Marked is the option to export the formatted text to a PDF or copy the underlying HTML.</p>

<p>Time will tell, which one of the two (if any) will end up beeing used by me in the long run. I have the slight feeling that it might be iA Writer for the auto markdown. Although I would miss the solarized look.</p>

<p>One final tip for all three apps: Add the following lines to your .bashrc or .profile:</p>

<pre><code>alias md="open -a Marked"
alias wr="open -a WriteRoom"
alias ia="open -a iA\ Writer"
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow you to open any file in the corresponding application directly from the commandline.</p>

<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/12/04/ssh-housekeeping</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer: This post is primarily aimed at myself. No information here that can&#8217;t be found via google.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using the same ssh public/private key for about 5 years and probably a minimum of three OS reinstalls.</p>

<p>Since that time, my personal password policy has changed. Gone are the times of easy, memorable passwords. I use <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to manage all my passwords.</p>

<p>Since I have no reason to believe that my private key has been compromised, I thought it might be time to change the password on the key.</p>

<p>To change the password on an ssh private key, use the ssh-keygen command, that you probably already used to create the key in the first place.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p>The lower-case p-param will ask ssh-keygen to change the passphrase of the file that is passed as an argument to -f.</p>

<p>On that account, I also changed the hostname in the public part of the key to reflect my current machine. Just edit ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in a text editor and change the hostname at the end of the key. It is just an identifier after all.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Google Reader (-1)]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/11/07/google-reader-1/"/>
<updated>2011-11-07T19:16:00+01:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/11/07/google-reader-1</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>tl;dr: I don&#8217;t like the new Google Reader UI. I&#8217;m using <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for now and I like it a lot.</em></p>

<p>I used to be big fan of google reader. It was never pretty but it worked and it solved the syncing problem for
me. I&#8217;m a heavy feed-user, I&#8217;m subscribed to many dozens of feeds with something in the range of about 200 new items per
day. I read some during my commute, some during compilation/redeployment time. And the rest in the evening. I usually
read my feeds on at least three devices. My Mac at work, my Mac at home and my iPhone. And since I got myself an iPad 2
I use that more and more (usually at the cost of my Mac at home) to read my feeds. Without sync, this would be a total
mess. I basically have had to skim over every article 4 times, discarding most of them 4 times.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>On iOS I tried <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/byline/id284946773?mt=8">Byline</a> and <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for
a longer time, switching between both. But during the last months I kept using Reeder and never looked back. Reeder has
a nice, sleek interface, integrates very well with the services I tend to use (mainly <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="https://www.readability.com/mo/">Readability</a>). I never seriously used any of the social features of any of those apps or Reader itself. This setup worked very well for me. Google Reader in Safari on the Macs and Reeder on iOS. This worked so well for me that I did not even really checked out Reeder for Mac that was released some time ago.</p>

<p>But a few days ago Google took it away. I assume in an attempt to push Google Plus even further down our throats, they
completely redesigned Google Reader to look more like Plus and the rest of google. Apparently they also changed some
social features of Reader, but none that I used. However the new Design annoyed me more and more the longer I looked at
it. It looks so broken, unfinished. All those grey rects and bars. It is hard to see where an article starts and ends.
Is this already the menu?
I look at it and wait for the CSS to finish loading. But it is already there. That is how it is supposed to look?
Seriously?</p>

<p>Something had to happen and I started looking for alternatives. My first instinct was to look at Reeder but a coleague
of mine recommended <a href="http://www.apparentsoft.com/socialite">Socialite</a> to me (ironicaly via G+). Both are about 8€ on tha MAS
and I tried both for a few days.</p>

<p>Socialite integrates Reader and many more Services, like Twitter, facebook and flickr into a clean, native Mac UI. Apart
from Twitter, none of these were of interest to me. Sadly there is no <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a> support in
Socialite yet. Having both, tweets and unread articles in the same unread box sounded nice but to me didn&#8217;t work in
practice. My Reader feeds already hava a rather bad signal to noise ratio. But the noise ratio in Twitter is just so high, that it drowns the signal-articles altogether.</p>

<p>This left Socialite with no real competitive advantage to Reeder. The UI/UX from Reeder somehow better fit my taste. I
tried both in parallel for a while and started using only Reeder after a short time. The keyboard navigation in Reeder
just works as I expect it. Probably because I use Reeder on iOS for ages, I somehow feel at home in Reeder. So my
current setup is having Reeder in fullscreen and switching over to it from time to time. This works great and I&#8217;ll keep
using it this way for now.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really want to advice anyone against Socialite. There is nothing wrong with it. Socialite and Reeder are both great apps and priced
very fair. You should probably just give both a testrun and see what works best for you.</p>

<p>However, once in a while, probably out of a bad habbit, I still hit my Google Reader shortcut in Safari - and everytime, the looks of it make me shiver away.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit annoyed by google for crippling Reader and I am not <a href="http://fury.com/2011/11/my-offer-to-google-reader/">alone</a> with my oppinion. It seems like google slowly starts losing it with their strong focus on plus. Their services and offerings start to annoy me more and more to the point that I actively look for alternatives. Has anything good come out of the plus-ification of their stuff yet?</p>

<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/10/24/going-live</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lazy me. Aparently it has been nearly two months since I last played with this blog. So instead of planing to tinker
with it more and more, I decided to just go live.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So&#8230; here it is. I still have lots of plans what to do. I feel the strong urge to customize the default octopress
design a bit. Maybe tweak it a bit here and there. My publishing workflow is also far from perfect. Right now, I deploy
to an ec2 instance via rsync. I doubt, that this is the cheapest or fastest possible way. And I really want to automate
something with dropbox so that I can create new posts from my iPad.</p>

<p>But if I finish all this before going live, I would probably never start this damn blog. I hope it will grow and
flourish as I go with it.</p>

<p>The next few postings aren&#8217;t going to be about <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/categories/meta/">meta-blogging</a> topics.</p>

<p>The basics are set up and running. I even added an <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/impressum.html">Impressum</a> to be a bit safer in the shark-infested minefield that the german internet is from a juristic stance.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a few weeks of not doing anything to my blog at all I decided to switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="octopress">octopress</a>. It looks like a nice
project and seems to fit most of my needs. I am currently setting up some form of deployment and tinkering with the
styles. I am currently writing the posts locally and deploy them to an ec2 instance. But I would like to get a setup
running where I can edit and create posts on the go from my iPad. Ideally without ssh-ing into ec2.</p>
