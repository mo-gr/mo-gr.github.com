      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>We&#8217;ve been in Beijing for over a month by now. After that time I feel quite confident in saying, that Beijing is just another big city. It is quite <em>western</em> and very big. If you look at it from a high enough level, it is very similar to other big cities. There is public transportation. People have jobs. There is a large middle class. People buy designer clothes in huge malls. Just the usual.</p>

<p>It is the same shit like home, albeit <em>some</em> things are different. If you zoom in close enough, you can see lots of small differences. In the way, the city works, the society works. Really, it&#8217;s all over the place. In the <em>Small Differences</em> series of posts, I plan to point out those differences, I found noticeable.</p>

<h1>Small Differences: Prepaid</h1>

<p>Having a prepaid cell phone is a very common thing here in Beijing like in many other big cities all around the globe. However, cell phones are not the only thing coming as prepaid variant over here. A few days ago, we had to find out, that also gas, water and electricity are often prepaid in China. And how do you discover something like that? Of course by standing under the shower and enjoying a lack of warm water. We complained to the landlord and low and behold - the next day someone came with a smart card, shoved it somewhere into the gas-meter and everything was fine again.</p>

<p>They also showed us the cards. This is a bit useless since we have no idea at all how to recharge those cards. But I can at least show them here. In order from top to bottom: Water, electricity and gas.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/147h19vten5i5c2/Prepaid.jpg?dl=1"></p>

<p>If you think about it, it actually isn&#8217;t that bad of an idea. At least people can&#8217;t get in situations, where they all of a sudden have to repay huge sums because they used more gas then anticipated.</p>

<p>I will write about heating here another time. There is a small difference to heating as well, although it is not prepaid like gas, water and electricity.</p>

<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/10/11/take-a-deep-breath</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks before we started our journey, a friend of mine gave me a
link to an article in the german Tagesspiegel (<a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/leben-in-china-dicke-luft-in-peking-/6848760.html">link</a>). The author of that article stayed a while in Beijing as well. And according to her, the quality of the air in Beijing is usually so bad,
it took the author over a week to realize that her apartment had a view
on the mountains.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Beijing, we had a clear blue sky. So naturally, I was
thinking the author exaggerated a bit. That is, until yesterday, when I
realized that our apartment had a view on the mountains as well. It took
us <em>just</em> five days to realize that.</p>

<p>I took a picture from our window that morning. Today – also a nice
day with lots of sun – I tried to take the same picutre again. Same ISO, same
aperture, same shutter speed, roughly the same time of the day. I merged those images. This is the result:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/e211rvp9v1fnn6s/Airquality.jpg?dl=1" title="Overlay of a clear and a usual day" ></p>

<p>To be honest, I made one mistake. I let the camera on
auto-white-balance. This probably overstates the difference a bit.
Anyways, take a deep breath and enjoy.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Elevator Rushhour]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/10/08/elevator-rushhour/"/>
<updated>2012-10-08T09:35:00+08:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/10/08/elevator-rushhour</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning, we encountered something, I didn&#8217;t knew existed: <em>Elevator
Rushhour</em>. I&#8217;ve never lived in a 28 story building before. We now live
on the 21st floor. If every floor is roughly the same as ours, there are 12
apartments on each floor.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>=&gt; (* 28 12)
</span><span class='line'>; 336</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So there are a good 300 apartments. The building currently has three working elevators.
Even if we assume that not every
apartment is inhabited and not every inhabitant has to get up in
the morning to get to work, this leaves us with a lot of people that
need to exit the building in a narrow timeframe.</p>

<p>We left at 8:00. And we waited for nearly 10 minutes to finally leave the
building. The elevators were all basically stopping at every other floor
on their way down. Then going all the way up again only to repeat the
stop and go on their way down.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jlts0qrpwciy9yy/map.jpg?dl=1" title="'A map of the places where we took pictures'" ></p>

<p>We have arrived in Beijing and I could already write a lot about it. But I won&#8217;t do that now because I don&#8217;t want all of our Russia impressions to get lost in time and memory. This post is intended two give a rather brief overview about our time there (but fails to be brief). More detailed stories are following soon (I hope).</p>

<!--more-->


<h1>Москва</h1>

<p>We arrived in the late afternoon in Moscow Domodedovo and proceeded to the German embassy to meet a friend of A. We grossly underestimated the time it took us to get there. Moscow is <em>huge</em>! And busy like hell during rush hour. And I mean seriously busy. And huge. Berlin is tiny and calm compared to Moscow at rush hour.</p>

<p>Nonetheless we had a very nice evening in Moscow with some beer, квас and great Ukrainian food (don&#8217;t ask). The next day, we did the usual sight seeing before getting our bags out of the embassy and going back to Domodedovo to catch our plane to Irkutsk. All in all, our Moscow trip was short and intense, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. One thing about Domodedovo: guys, broken and rotten airplanes are not the best decoration for an airport. It creates nervous feelings.</p>

<h1>Lake Baikal</h1>

<p><img class="right" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mapyz7GE9q1rgtzh1o1_500.jpg" width="350" title="'Blurry Irkutsk'" ></p>

<p>This marks the start of an amazing, yet exhausting week in Siberia. We arrived in Иркутск (Irkutsk) before sunrise, somehow managed to get on a trolley bus to the center and walked the rest to the hostel, at which we intended to stay a week later. At the hostel, we woke the poor lady in charge that day, dropped off some of our baggage, we wouldn&#8217;t need in Russia and left again. Without sleep or real breakfast, we moved to the ferry port to take the boat to Листвянка (Lystvyanka) - at least that was the plan. However the boat was already sold out. This was a bit off a downer.</p>

<p>
<img class="left" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/m80hfloz63vmu23/Lystvyanka.jpg?dl=1" width="350" title="'Lystvyanka'" >

We were not the only ones who were in this sad situation. There were two Russian couples in their early thirties with their children who wanted to go to Lystvyanka as well. It is safe to say there was a slight language barrier between us. They decided to go there by Маршгутка (Marschrutka) instead of the boat and kindly offered to take us along. Although it took them and us a while to communicate that.

If you&#8217;ve never been in a Marschrutka before, this can be a bit scary and it absolutely deserves a post of its own. Lets just say, it was a relief to do it together with locals for the first time. 
About an hour later we arrived in Lystvyanka - sleep deprived and tired. This might add up to the fact that we were a bit disappointed about it. Lake Baikal is beautiful! But Lystvyanka is a rather boring tourist trap for Russians. And off-season there really wasn&#8217;t that much to do or see. Somehow we were expecting more. 
</p>


<p>Therefore we changed our plan a bit and got on the ferry to Port Baikal on the opposite side of the River Ангара (Angara). The ferry looked a bit&#8230; Let&#8217;s call her battle proven.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yuctifmxdhysqos/ferry.jpg?dl=1" title="'Ferry to Port Baikal'" ></p>

<p>Port Baikal also deserves its own entry. A long time ago it must have been a thriving place – a key port to the Trans Siberian Express. Now it is just a shadow of its former self. But it has a calm, melancholic beauty and is a good place to start short hikes. We stayed there for two nights, had a great time and met some wonderful people who are now new friends of ours (Ivan &amp; Mascha).</p>

<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maulaqXJB41rgtzh1o1_1280.jpg" title="View from over Port Baikal" ></p>

<p>In Port Baikal we also discovered that our original plan of going directly to Слюдянка (Sludyanka) via train was not feasible. The time schedule of the trains is a bit weird. So we went back to Lystvyanka via ferry, took another Marschrutka (this time on our own) to Irkutsk and stayed there for an unplanned night.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vlo20pdpogixxlh/cat%20galina.jpg?dl=1" width="350" title="'Galinas Cat'" ></p>

<p>After we arrived in Irkutsk, we must have looked a bit lost because a lady, that was on the same Marschrutka asked us if we might need help. Turned out, she was German and lived in the area for a while now. She recommended us a nice pension (Pension Galina), called there to make sure, they have room for us and told us the way. Then she disappeared. We were very thankful (and lucky) we met her. The pension was very nice. Galina herself looks a bit like a friendly witch. She lives in an old, wooden house with a beautiful cat and makes amazing влини for breakfast. And she even talks a bit German.</p>

<p>After our first shower in days and a good night of sleep, we left her in the early morning to take the regional train to Sludyanka.</p>

<p>At the train station, two young Americans (?) approached us: “do you speak English?” We said yes. “Very good! Here, this says&#8230;” At that point we interrupted them and told them, we don&#8217;t really speak Russian. Did we really already looked like locals to them? We tried anyway but couldn&#8217;t really help them. They had some sort of trouble getting their preordered train ticket. I hope they somehow figured it out.</p>

<h1>Siberian Taiga</h1>

<p>We went to Sludyanka in order to hike up to Пик Черского (peak Cherskogo) and see lake heart. It is said to be good for a young couple to see lake heart together. I guess we are on the safe side now because in the end we did manage to see the lake. However we would not have made it without the help of two other nice people we met in Sludyanka.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9uripvn93yysjkp/lake%20heart.jpg?dl=1" width="350" title="'Lake Heart'" ></p>

<p>Since we arrived in Sludyanka too late to start the hike the same day, we stayed for a night at the local mineral museum that also has a guest house. We asked them whether it is possible to get up to the peak and back down on the same day. Apparently it has been done before but it requires top physical condition. We decided to try.</p>

<p>In the evening however two middle aged men also arrived there: Andrei and Nikolai. They had a slightly longer hike planned than ours (with a much more relaxed time schedule). But the peak was their first stop as well. They offered to take us along with them. And they assured us that there is a base camp were we could sleep (even without a sleeping bag). We agreed to join them and spend the following night together with them at the camp.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ab9vrypyqyxw9ie/basecamp.jpg?dl=1" title="'View from the Basecemp'" ></p>

<p>Nikolai is a professional guide in the area and his skills were very useful. The next day started rainy which would quickly turn into snowy as we progressed. And hiking in Russia is different. The trail is not really marked. You can see where people usually walk and that is it. No painted trees or rocks like on European routes. And with a few cm of snow, it is very easy to loose the trail. But Nikolai knew the area very well and got us safely to the Base camp.</p>

<p>The two days with Nikolai and Andrei are also worth a separate post. In short, we managed to get to the lake together. However A. and myself sadly had to turn around a few hundred meters before we could reach the actual peak to get back to Sludyanka in the evening.</p>

<h1>TransSib</h1>

<p><img class="right" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nm8uiomgfu8nku8/ulan%20head.jpg?dl=1" width="350" title="'Ulan Udes head'" ></p>

<p>We had to make it back down that day because we had tickets to a 2nd class sleeping car in the trans sib to Улан Уле (Ulan Ude). The train departed around midnight local time. If you ever get to take a train in Russia, be aware: times are always announced in Moscow time - no matter where and in which time zone you are!</p>

<p>The sleeping car was quite pleasant and we had a four person cabin just for us. We even managed to get a few hours of sleep. In Ulan Ude, we did the usual sight seeing. Learned a bit about buriat culture and visited a Buddhist temple. After some buriat food in the evening, we got to the station again to catch another train the same evening back to Irkutsk. But this time in 3rd class. Lets just say, the difference is obvious and the ride was not as pleasant as the first one.</p>

<h1>Irkutsk - finally</h1>

<p><img class="right" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb4bbgAKhA1rgtzh1o1_500.jpg" width="350" title="'Irkutsk Airport'" ></p>

<p>We arrived late in the night (~ 2:00), got to the hostel where our baggage was stored, took the second shower in Siberia and slept. We slept well and long.</p>

<p>After we finally got up and had a little breakfast - nah&#8230; lunch - at a wonderful small place that had tasty local food, some culture: the local art museum which claims to be the biggest in Siberia. Later in the afternoon, we met Ivan and Mascha again and spent some great time together. They showed us a bit around in Irkutsk. We went to a fire jugglers spectacle and finally settled down in a local brewpub (!!!) that had a few really good beers! (I have to tag it in open street map soon so it&#8217;ll show up in the openbrewpub map). In the end, we said goodbye at the Аеропорт around 23.30 and tried to check in to our flight to Beijing. If you ever get to Irkutsk, be aware, the Аеропорт and the Airport are different buildings! However, they are right next to each other. One is for domestic and the other for international flights.</p>

<h1>Take away</h1>

<p>In the end, we both agree, that we had a very exhausting but wonderful time in Siberia. The nature is breathtakingly beautiful. Surprisingly similar to german nature but on a much bigger scale. You can see up to the horizon without a trace of human constructions. If you enjoy hiking, consider visiting the Baikal area! However, without A.’s sparse Russian skills we would have had problems - basic understanding of the Russian language is a requirement in the area.</p>

<p>Another thing that is very different: the extreme temperature difference between day and night. The afternoons were usually very fit for t shirts. However as soon as the sun set, temperature fell quickly below zero. The upside: no moskitos. This makes the Siberian autumn a great time for a visit!</p>

<p>One more thing must be mentioned: the people in the area! Each and every one of the people (except one - who was very drunk), we had direct interactions with in Siberia were extremely kind, friendly and tried to help us as much as possible. In that sense: thanks to everyone and до свидания!</p>

<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/09/11/big-travel</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_madug76njY1rgtzh1o1_1280.jpg" title="'Ready to go on a tour'" ></p>

<p>On thrusday, in just a few short days, we will start quite a big travel.
First stop will be Moscow, where we stay for a day before we head on to
lake baikal for a week of hiking and vacation.</p>

<p>Next stop will be china. <em>A.</em> will be doing an internship in Beijing
starting in October and I will give her company as long as I&#8217;m permitted
to stay in China. Sadly it is not possible to stay in China as a tourist
for as long as an intern.</p>

<p>When my permission to stay in China expires, we will have to part our
ways for a few weeks. I will move on to South Korea and Japan (and maybe
some more places where I don&#8217;t need a complicated visa).</p>

<p>At the end of december, we will rejoin at beijing airport to fly back
home together. Or at least that is the plan.</p>

<p>All of this is surely going to be very exciting and we are looking
forward to it a lot (although from time to time a bit nervously). Did I
mention, we don&#8217;t really speak any chinese language?</p>

<p>As a result of our travels, over the next few weeks and months, the focus of
this blog might shift a bit away from technical topics over to
documenting our travels.</p>

<p>Since I&#8217;m not sure about the conditions of the intertube access along
the way, this might be more or less complicated. I might have trouble
posting to this blog, therefore I&#8217;ve also set up accounts over at
<a href="http://mo-gr.tumblr.com">tumblr</a> and <a href="http://mo-gr.posterous.com">posterous</a>.
And be sure to also follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mo_gr">twitter</a> if
you want to stay up to date.</p>

<p>We will post pictures and status updates to at least one of those places
in a semi regular fashion.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Type Hints]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/04/16/type-hints/"/>
<updated>2012-04-16T22:59:00+08:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/04/16/type-hints</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, <a href="mana">Matthias Naber</a> made me aware of <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> type hints in JSF and JSP files.</p>

<p><a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> does quite a good job in figuring out the types of EL variables itself, providing code completion and usage information. But there are situations where <a href="idea">IDEA</a> is unable determine the type of an EL variable. This usually occurs to me in a facelet <code>composition</code> where the variables are passed in as a <code>param</code>.</p>

<p>The following is a basic facelt composition invocation:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ui:include src="toiletten.xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;ui:param name="toilette" value="#{umkleide.toiletten}"/&gt;
&lt;/ui:include&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the file containing the invocation, <a href="idea">IDEA</a> is fully aware of the type of the EL variables. However in the included file (toiletten.xhtml), which might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html" 
  xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"&gt;
  &lt;ui:composition&gt;
    &lt;h:outputLabel value="#{toilette.ppBecken}"/&gt;
  &lt;/ui:composition&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> is unable to infere the type of the EL variable <code>toilette</code>. It is therefore neither able to offer me code completion nor warn me about typos and errors. It might even mark the getter <code>getPpBecken()</code> in the Toilette as unused.</p>

<p>However, if you help <a href="idea">IDEA</a> a little bit by hinting the type, all the goodness is restored. Just add the following, proprietary comment somewhere in the file:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;!--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This comment tells <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> the type of the EL variable, enabling autocompletion, usage indexing and of course only marking true errors in the file.</p>

<p>If you are using JSPs, the comment should probably look something like:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;%--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are somehow worried about putting proprietary comments in your files, <em>you</em> have some weird issues. But nonetheless, those comments, at least in facelets, even work outside of the <code>composition</code>-tag, which will make them become ignored anyway.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html" 
  xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"&gt;
  &lt;!--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--&gt;
  &lt;ui:composition&gt;
    &lt;h:outputLabel value="#{toilette.ppBecken}"/&gt;
  &lt;/ui:composition&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A properly configured <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> setup will help you so many times a day. You are going to be a <em>lot</em> more productive. It is absolutely worth, adding some comments and guides to make the warnings and analyzations of your IDE more precise and focussed.</p>

<p>If I had gotten a coin for every time, I fixed a bug, that was already underlined and critized by <a href="idea">IDEA</a> when I found it, I&#8217;d have an aweful lot of coins.</p>

<p>Use your tools to their full advance and don&#8217;t check in code that contains warnings! I really wish, there would be something like the <code>-Werror</code> flag in <code>javac</code>!</p>

<updated>2012-03-31T16:39:00+08:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/03/31/berlin-expert-days</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This years <a href="http://bed-con.org/">Berlin Expert Days</a> conference has come to an end. The <a href="http://bed-con.org/">BEDCon</a> is a small tech conference in, you
guessed it, Berlin. The focus is somewhere around the Java ecosystem but it is no LASER sharp focus.</p>

<p>This years <a href="http://bed-con.org/">BEDCon</a> was full of high quality talks and interesting attendies. The conference sold out with somewhere
around 350 people and although some talks were a bit crowded, the atmosphere was very nice and friendly! Thanks to everyone who
contributed in one way or another! I had a great time.</p>

<h2>Why Coffee is good for developers</h2>

<p>This was the first conference, where I attended as a speaker. I gave a (hopefully) entertaining introduction to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> on
the second day titled <a href="http://bed-con.org/talks/why-coffee-is-good-for-developers/">Why Coffee is good for developers</a>. And judging by the feedback I got in person and via twitter, the talk was a huge success. Thanks to
everyone who attended! I hope you had as much fun listening as I had giving the talk!</p>

<p>I opened my talk with some facts about actual coffee as a pun on the title of the talk before spinning into
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> and the problems, it tries to solve. Some people told me, they liked the idea and also enjoyed my
facts about coffee. Although one person aparently didn&#8217;t liked it at all. He left before I even got to the interesting
parts probably thinking, I was talking about coffee for an hour. Maybe he is more of a tea guy :)</p>

<h2>HTML slides are gaining traction</h2>

<p>My <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/wcig4d">slides</a> are available online and the sources are on <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/wcig4d">github</a> too (Sorry, slides are in german.) The slides work best in Safari but should also work in Chrome. Non-WebKit Browsers are probably going to have some problems. Since a few people have asked me, I made the
slides with my own custom fork of the fabulous <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a>. I rewrote it in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> and modified it quite a
bit for this presentation. If you plan to use it, at this moment, I have to recomment using <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a> over my fork. I
plan to put some more effort into my fork and iron out many of the wrinkles. But at the moment, <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a> is more
stable and more active. I&#8217;ll post here when there are news about my fork.</p>

<p>I was by far not the only speaker with HTML slides. An intersting trend, that I really do appreciate. HTML slides tend
to be less bullet point ridden than powerpoint slides. The presentations are often more interactive and engaging. The slides are easier and faster to
share after the talk and they discourage the stupid idea of printing out slides. But as <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a> calls out in its
readme, they &#8220;may not help you if you have nothing interesting to say ;)&#8221;</p>

<p>One other framework for HTML slides, that looked very intersting was <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/spinscale">Alexander Reelsen</a> used it for his
slides and they looked great. But then again, he also hat something interesting to say&#8230;</p>

<p>If you have anything to do with the web at all, check out one of the options for HTML slides! Not only is it fun to
create the slides, it is also a nice exercise for your web-fu! And you can use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ</a> instead of PowerPoint for
creating slides - how awesome is that?!</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Octoflattr]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/03/19/octoflattr/"/>
<updated>2012-03-19T10:54:00+08:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/03/19/octoflattr</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>tl;dr:</em> <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/not-a-blog/commit/1408219062aa8aac81abf54431d5edcd638dff2b">Here</a> is how I integrated <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into my octopress blog.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Flattr</h2>

<p>Over the weekend, I integrated <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into my blog. <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> is an
online payment system for giving small donations to content creators
over the internet. It is a neat way to <em>tip</em> people on the web. It
slowly gains some traction in Europe and many german content creators have it
integrated into their services. Even some newspapers like the german
<a href="http://taz.de">taz</a> integrate <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> to give users of their online portal an easy
way to voluntarily pay for news articles.</p>

<p>In the USA it is not that common yet. Although pages, like <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a>
started integrating flattr recently as well.</p>

<h2>Octopress integration</h2>

<p>For the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> Integration, I basically used a
solution by <a href="http://blog.simonszu.de">Simon Szustkowski</a> that I found
via google. His solution is very straight forward. He gave a detailed
description of it on his <a href="http://blog.simonszu.de/2012/02/flattr-fur-octopress/">blog</a>
(which is in german) and there is also an octopress fork with the
changes included over <a href="https://github.com/bascht/octopress/commit/e2591467af488bceb2ed058220865cc5111e4f3e#diff-1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Following that way, you get a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> button on every post. In addition to that,
I also created a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> button for the blog as a whole and added it to
the asides. My changes to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> can be seen
<a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/not-a-blog/commit/1408219062aa8aac81abf54431d5edcd638dff2b">here</a>.
They integrate Simons solution and my Button for the blog into one
commit to my blog repo.
The <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Thing for the blog must be created manually on the <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> homepage
and the URL to that thing must be put in your <code>_config.yml</code> under
<code>flattr_blog_thing</code>. If that configuration is set and the custom aside
is enabled in the <code>default_asides</code>, there will be a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Button in
the aside.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2106894.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>default_asides: [asides/recent_posts.html, asides/twitter.html, asides/github.html, asides/googleplus.html, custom/asides/flattr.html]
# ... snip ...
# Flattr
flattr_user: mogr
flattr_blog_thing: http://flattr.com/thing/582242/Not-a-blog</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>All other changes are directly from Simons solution. when the
<code>flattr_user</code> is set in <code>_config.yml</code>, the flattr-api Javascript will be
included in the header <code>source/_include/custom/head.html</code>. This will
also conditionally include <code>flattr_button.html</code> in the sharing area below each
post <code>source/_includes/post/sharing.html</code>. The <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Things are
automatically generated by the <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> API when someone first clicks on
one of those buttons. (A <em>Thing</em> in Flattr-Lingo is something you can
give money to.)</p>

<h2>Official support?</h2>

<p>By the way, the currently <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/255#issuecomment-2566028">official stance</a> of <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is to not
integrate <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into the core of <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. <a href="https://github.com/imathis">Brandon</a> wants to keep <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>
lean and have only the essentials in the core - which I think is very
reasonable. Maybe there will be an official Flattr-pluign sometime in
the future. Until then, I hope this helps other people integrating <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into their
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> setups. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/about.html">contact</a>
me.</p>

<p>And if you havn&#8217;t yet tried <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a>, go ahead and make the internet a
better place for everyone!</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Code clouds]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/02/12/code-clouds/"/>
<updated>2012-02-12T19:04:00+08:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/02/12/code-clouds</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I&#8217;ve been to <a href="http://jz11.java.no/news.html">Javazone</a> and among the many great speakers was
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kevlinhenney">Kevlin Henney</a>. His talk was titled <a href="http://vimeo.com/28772428">Cool Code</a> and if you havn&#8217;t seen it, I can highly recommend it! (same goes for all talks by Kevlin).</p>

<p>One of the things he mentioned in his talk were word clouds generated
from code to get a good overview of what a programm is about. They
provide no hard facts but a very intersting insight nonetheless. The
following is a word cloud generated from <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">hibernate-core</a> with the 100
most common words in the codebase. The bigger the word, the more common
it is.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.notadomain.com/images/hibernate-cloud.png" alt="Cloud of hibernate-core" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>On the first glance, one can see, that hibernate deals with lots of
Strings and takes a great deal of work to somehow handle null. Names and
sessions are important to hiberante as well and obviously, hiberante
also deals with transactions.</p>

<p>I really like this kind of visualization of code. It provides no hard facts but it can help detect code smells and project priorities. If <em>String</em> is very common, this might be a sign of an insufficient domain model. Maybe a few more classes should be introduced. Same goes for <em>Object</em>. In general, a code cloud should talk about the domain of the programm. About customers, orders and the like. It should not talk about implementation details like Strings or booleans. (Since <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/">hibernate-core</a> is a general library, it might be ok, that transactions and sessions are not the primary words but Strings and Objects - although I somehow doubt it). Use code clouds as an additional datapoint, don&#8217;t rely to heavily on them and they might turn out to be a useful little tool in your analysis box.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://jz11.java.no/news.html">Javazone</a>, I
tried to create code clouds for the projects, I was working on. However I
couldn&#8217;t find a good tool. <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a> generates nice clouds, but it works
only online. I am not so comfortable with uploading my complete
codebase of customer projects to some website. So <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a> was out of
the game.
Apparently there were a few Windows tools, but I didn&#8217;t check them out.
But the idea of code clouds stuck with me.</p>

<p>Then a few days ago, I read a post on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a> about <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a> by
[Jason Davies]. <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a> is a layout plugin for the amazing JavaScript
data visualization engine <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a>. This was all I needed.</p>

<p>So I started playing around with it a bit and created <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Cloudserver">cloudserver</a>. The
above cloud of hibernate-core was created with it.</p>

<p>Since I wanted to get into <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a> anyway, this was a good start. And
if I am working in JavaScript anyway, why not try it in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>? And
if I am working in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>, why not just do it in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>?</p>

<p>So <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Cloudserver">cloudserver</a> got a bit of a playground of technologies. It is mostly
written in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>. It reads in source files, cleans them up a
bit and counts each word. After it is done processing all files, it
brings them in a <a href="https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud">d3-cloud</a>-friendly format and starts a local <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>
webserver. This server serves a small html file that contains the <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a>
bootstrap code and generates the cloud.</p>

<p>I tried to keep it mostly language agnostic with a pluggable system to
configure it to specific languages. Currenlty it only supports Java, but
it should be fairly easy to make langauge configurations for other
languages.</p>

<p>I have lots of ideas on how to improve <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Cloudserver">cloudserver</a>, like stripping
comments. And it is surely not bugfree. Since this is my
first contact with <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> and I am still not very mature in
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, I assume there are lots of rookie-mistakes lurking
around.</p>

<p>I plan to write up my impressions of <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> and <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> in
seperate posts.</p>

<p>If you used <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Cloudserver">cloudserver</a>, have questions or ideas, I would love to hear
from you! I would also love to show you some more clouds, but I
currently only have customer-projects with interesting code bases
around - and I am not comfortable with presenting them here.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>tl;dr: SSDs are awesome. Don&#8217;t have one? Get one!</em></p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/165601/blog/rocket.jpg" title="&#34;Picture completely unrelated to post - Happy new year&#34;" alt="&#34;Picture completely unrelated to post - Happy new year&#34;"></p>

<p>I got a late christmas gift in the form of a <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004W2JL2A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=notadomaincom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B004W2JL2A">Crucial M4 256G*</a> Solid State Drive. But let me start a bit earlier.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I wrote my diploma thesis on my trusty old Mid-2009 13&#8221; MacBook Pro. By far not the fastest machine even by Mid-2009 standards but fast enough for most of my needs most of the time. When I started at <a href="http://spree.de">akquinet</a> last year, they got me a 2.2 GHz i7 17&#8221; MacBook Pro and wow, that thing was fast! Especially compared to my old 13&#8221;. Even though the i7 was equipped with a traditional spinning disk hard disk, it felt way faster.</p>

<p>But I still use my 13&#8221; a lot and since everybody was singing the song of the SSD, I gut myself an <a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B003NE5JCY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=notadomaincom-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B003NE5JCY">OCZ Vertex 2*</a> to see what their tune was all about. And it was music… pure music. All of a sudden, the mighty i7 17&#8221; felt dead slow to me. It was like trying to ride on a dead horse. Where my aging 13&#8221; was snappy and responsive, the spinning disk in the 17&#8221; made it feel like it was heaving trouble getting up at all.</p>

<p>They say, the only people not recommending an SSD to you, are those, that don&#8217;t have one themself. This can&#8217;t be more true. Remember the old days of the late 90ies. When the best thing you could do to your computer was add more RAM. Always. Those days are over. Screw RAM. I have Gigs idling around all the time. Today the very best performance upgrade that money can buy is a solid state disk! Yes, they are expensive. More expensive than spinning disks. But they are worth every cent. 256 Gig SSDs are not absurdly expensive and they are a size that one can live with. Flush out all your huge files on to a big disk and live with the slight inconvenience of having to attach a USB drive when you want to watch that blue-ray rip. Once you&#8217;ve tasted the blood of an SSD you won&#8217;t go back!</p>

<p>Speaking of blood, I should probably mention one caveat. SSDs are not per se less reliable than spinning disks. But they apparently have a tendency to fail big time when they do fail. Think in terms of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/05/the-hot-crazy-solid-state-drive-scale.html">oh-my-God-what-just-happened-to-all-my-data</a>. I&#8217;ll report when one of my SSDs has gone that way. Until then, Time Machine and myself will be good friends and seeing each other quite frequently.</p>

<p>By the way, I decided to start fresh with the new SSD and reinstalled Lion from scratch. Thanks to a rather fast internet connection, the cloud in general and iCloud in particular as well was a recent time machine backup, I&#8217;ve got my system from SSD-in-my-hand to ready-for-production-work in about 3 to 4 hours. This made me really appreciate the Mac App Store. In the time it took me to search for the licenses in my mails, I got all apps from the MAS ready to go with no interaction. Downloaded and licensed. No registration-key-copy-pasta. This was such a pleasant experience that I seriously consider purchasing MAS-Versions of the applications that I got pre-MAS that are available in the MAS by now.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michaelschuetz">Michael</a> and myself have been hacking some features into a specific version of <a href="http://www.jboss.org/picketlink">picketlink</a>. An update to a newer version was out of the question. We blogged about it over <a href="http://blog.akquinet.de/2011/12/26/patching-picketlink-to-support-multiple-ldap-stores/">here</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I really like to get my head around existing code bases. Finding my ways through them and fixing or modifing them. I should do that far more often!</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t want to rant too much about picketlink. It works most of the time. But man… there are some code smells in there. If I&#8217;m modifying a class somewhere down around line 3500-something, this is a smell. If a class needs more than 1000 LoC, it should probably not be a single class. DRY anyone? Enough of a rant… Our modifications aren&#8217;t really that much better. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_window_theory">Broken window theory</a> at work…</p>

<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/12/04/distraction-free-writing</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of fat, bloaty WYSIWYMG text editors. Some people call them word processors. Most of my longer texts in university have been written in LaTeX/vim. This also includes my diploma thesis. Every longer experience with the so called word processors made me hate them even more. I like the appeal of writing - and basically thinking - in plain text files. Having a confusing UI and lots of inconsistend formatting in the document is very annoying to me. But for everyday work, LaTeX is just too much of an overhead and, more often than not, feels arcane.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Recently, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber&#8217;s</a> markdown has sparked up everywhere. I really like it and since it is used in <a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress</a> I have to use it anyway. It basically solves the same problem, that LaTeX overengineers for me. It gives me a way to write plain text with some lightweight, natural markup for the occasional link or <em>emphasized</em> word. It is an awesome combo for most of the things I write.</p>

<p>And while I really like to use vim, especially the awesome <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>, all the bells and whistles of it feel a bit too much when all I want to do is write a simple blog post. Apprently I am not the only one, thinking like that. There are a few new texteditors that offer not much more than plain text editing. Probably the biggest two are <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a> and <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iA Writer</a>. I havn&#8217;t yet picked my personal favorite.</p>

<p>I like the inline-markdown preview/support of iA Writer and the iCloud support. But I am not so sure about the total lack of configurablility. iA Writer lets you configure nothing. WriteRoom lets you pick your own colors and fonts. I am using the Solarized Dark Theme from the Ethan Schoonovers <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized</a> project, which I am currently using about everywhere. It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111204-jyx7tgkg65ps8qm4pp6dg417x2.jpg"></p>

<p>A screenshot of iA makes no really sense as it always looks the same. Just head over to their <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">site</a> to see how it looks.</p>

<p>Since WriteRoom doesn&#8217;t support markdown, I use it in combination with <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, a simple markdown previewer. Marked doesn&#8217;t support all octopress extensions, but it is very lightweight and works well for basic previews. Another neat feature of Marked is the option to export the formatted text to a PDF or copy the underlying HTML.</p>

<p>Time will tell, which one of the two (if any) will end up beeing used by me in the long run. I have the slight feeling that it might be iA Writer for the auto markdown. Although I would miss the solarized look.</p>

<p>One final tip for all three apps: Add the following lines to your .bashrc or .profile:</p>

<pre><code>alias md="open -a Marked"
alias wr="open -a WriteRoom"
alias ia="open -a iA\ Writer"
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow you to open any file in the corresponding application directly from the commandline.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer: This post is primarily aimed at myself. No information here that can&#8217;t be found via google.</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using the same ssh public/private key for about 5 years and probably a minimum of three OS reinstalls.</p>

<p>Since that time, my personal password policy has changed. Gone are the times of easy, memorable passwords. I use <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to manage all my passwords.</p>

<p>Since I have no reason to believe that my private key has been compromised, I thought it might be time to change the password on the key.</p>

<p>To change the password on an ssh private key, use the ssh-keygen command, that you probably already used to create the key in the first place.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p>The lower-case p-param will ask ssh-keygen to change the passphrase of the file that is passed as an argument to -f.</p>

<p>On that account, I also changed the hostname in the public part of the key to reflect my current machine. Just edit ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in a text editor and change the hostname at the end of the key. It is just an identifier after all.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Google Reader (-1)]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/11/07/google-reader-1/"/>
<updated>2011-11-07T19:16:00+08:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/11/07/google-reader-1</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>tl;dr: I don&#8217;t like the new Google Reader UI. I&#8217;m using <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for now and I like it a lot.</em></p>

<p>I used to be big fan of google reader. It was never pretty but it worked and it solved the syncing problem for
me. I&#8217;m a heavy feed-user, I&#8217;m subscribed to many dozens of feeds with something in the range of about 200 new items per
day. I read some during my commute, some during compilation/redeployment time. And the rest in the evening. I usually
read my feeds on at least three devices. My Mac at work, my Mac at home and my iPhone. And since I got myself an iPad 2
I use that more and more (usually at the cost of my Mac at home) to read my feeds. Without sync, this would be a total
mess. I basically have had to skim over every article 4 times, discarding most of them 4 times.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>On iOS I tried <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/byline/id284946773?mt=8">Byline</a> and <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> for
a longer time, switching between both. But during the last months I kept using Reeder and never looked back. Reeder has
a nice, sleek interface, integrates very well with the services I tend to use (mainly <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="https://www.readability.com/mo/">Readability</a>). I never seriously used any of the social features of any of those apps or Reader itself. This setup worked very well for me. Google Reader in Safari on the Macs and Reeder on iOS. This worked so well for me that I did not even really checked out Reeder for Mac that was released some time ago.</p>

<p>But a few days ago Google took it away. I assume in an attempt to push Google Plus even further down our throats, they
completely redesigned Google Reader to look more like Plus and the rest of google. Apparently they also changed some
social features of Reader, but none that I used. However the new Design annoyed me more and more the longer I looked at
it. It looks so broken, unfinished. All those grey rects and bars. It is hard to see where an article starts and ends.
Is this already the menu?
I look at it and wait for the CSS to finish loading. But it is already there. That is how it is supposed to look?
Seriously?</p>

<p>Something had to happen and I started looking for alternatives. My first instinct was to look at Reeder but a coleague
of mine recommended <a href="http://www.apparentsoft.com/socialite">Socialite</a> to me (ironicaly via G+). Both are about 8€ on tha MAS
and I tried both for a few days.</p>

<p>Socialite integrates Reader and many more Services, like Twitter, facebook and flickr into a clean, native Mac UI. Apart
from Twitter, none of these were of interest to me. Sadly there is no <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a> support in
Socialite yet. Having both, tweets and unread articles in the same unread box sounded nice but to me didn&#8217;t work in
practice. My Reader feeds already hava a rather bad signal to noise ratio. But the noise ratio in Twitter is just so high, that it drowns the signal-articles altogether.</p>

<p>This left Socialite with no real competitive advantage to Reeder. The UI/UX from Reeder somehow better fit my taste. I
tried both in parallel for a while and started using only Reeder after a short time. The keyboard navigation in Reeder
just works as I expect it. Probably because I use Reeder on iOS for ages, I somehow feel at home in Reeder. So my
current setup is having Reeder in fullscreen and switching over to it from time to time. This works great and I&#8217;ll keep
using it this way for now.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really want to advice anyone against Socialite. There is nothing wrong with it. Socialite and Reeder are both great apps and priced
very fair. You should probably just give both a testrun and see what works best for you.</p>

<p>However, once in a while, probably out of a bad habbit, I still hit my Google Reader shortcut in Safari - and everytime, the looks of it make me shiver away.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bit annoyed by google for crippling Reader and I am not <a href="http://fury.com/2011/11/my-offer-to-google-reader/">alone</a> with my oppinion. It seems like google slowly starts losing it with their strong focus on plus. Their services and offerings start to annoy me more and more to the point that I actively look for alternatives. Has anything good come out of the plus-ification of their stuff yet?</p>

<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2011/10/24/going-live</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lazy me. Aparently it has been nearly two months since I last played with this blog. So instead of planing to tinker
with it more and more, I decided to just go live.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>So&#8230; here it is. I still have lots of plans what to do. I feel the strong urge to customize the default octopress
design a bit. Maybe tweak it a bit here and there. My publishing workflow is also far from perfect. Right now, I deploy
to an ec2 instance via rsync. I doubt, that this is the cheapest or fastest possible way. And I really want to automate
something with dropbox so that I can create new posts from my iPad.</p>

<p>But if I finish all this before going live, I would probably never start this damn blog. I hope it will grow and
flourish as I go with it.</p>

<p>The next few postings aren&#8217;t going to be about <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/categories/meta/">meta-blogging</a> topics.</p>

<p>The basics are set up and running. I even added an <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/impressum.html">Impressum</a> to be a bit safer in the shark-infested minefield that the german internet is from a juristic stance.</p>
