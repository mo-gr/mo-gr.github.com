      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>tl;dr: This post describes how to build a multi-lingual
<a href="http://angularjs.org">angular.js</a> <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/ang18n">application</a> with a <a href="http://www.playframework.com">Play!</a> backend.</em></p>

<p>I get asked from time to time what I would use to start a new greenfield
web project these days. Of course the answer is always &lsquo;it depends&rsquo;.
Nonetheless, a lot of the times, <a href="http://angularjs.org">angular.js</a> comes up in those discussions.</p>

<p><a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a> is a client-side Model-View-Whatever framework
developed by Google with a lot of nice aspects and features. It provides
robust data binding to the DOM, URL routing for single-page applications
and has a very nice way to flexibly extend HTML for nice, declarative
code. <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a> has no requirements for the server side so
the question remains, what one might use on the server.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long been suspecting that <a href="http://angularjs.org">angular.js</a> would play very
well with a <a href="http://www.playframework.com">Play!</a> server but up until now I never actually tried it.
The Play! framework is a stateless, lightweight and scalable web framework written in
Scala that allows developing applications in either Scala or Java. One
of the very nice aspects of Play! is its template language, which is in
fact also Scala. This gives us compiled, statically type checked
templates. While this might seem irrelevant in the face of single-page
application, I believe this actually enables us to overcome one of
<a href="http://angularjs.org">angulars</a> more serious shortcomings, namely internationalization (i18n).</p>

<p>While <a href="http://angularjs.org">angular.js</a> does not completely ignore i18n, I think out
of the box it lacks an opinionated way of how to handle i18n, forcing
developers to come up with their own ways to handle multi-language
applications.</p>

<p>So, I too came up with my own way, combining the strengths of
<a href="http://www.playframework.com">Play!</a> and <a href="http://angularjs.org">angular.js</a> to handle i18n. As an example, I created a useless little todo-list
app (the hello world of web applications). The todo-list uses Play!
2.1.3 on the server. The front-end is written in angular.js 1.2.0rc1 (using
<a href="http://http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>, just because) and the ugly styling was my first
exposure to the new <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap v3</a>. An instance of the app is
hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> and can be laughed at <a href="http://ang18n-example.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. And
the code is of course over on <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/ang18n">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/code/todo-app.png" title="My lame todo app" ></p>

<h2>What is required for proper i18n?</h2>

<p>Proper multi language applications have to take care of three aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>the static texts in the templates must be translated</li>
<li>locale specific formatting must be done (especially regarding dates and numbers)</li>
<li>the user must be able to select a language</li>
</ol>


<p>The first thing is what <a href="http://angularjs.org">angular.js</a> has no strong opinion about.
Since we don&rsquo;t want to duplicate our templates for all supported
languages, this is where <a href="http://www.playframework.com">Play!</a> will help us. Play! will generate
the localized templates for us.
The second aspect is where angular is already doing quite well on its
own. And finally with the third aspect, we have to bring Play! and
angular.js together.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s tackle them in opposite order.</p>

<h2>Selecting a language</h2>

<p>The actual selection of a language is currently done in a simple select
box. One could go wild here. But please make sure to also
list the language in their own lingua (ever tried switching a japanese
Windows to another language? I knew I was in the language settings but I
had no idea what all the options were supposed to mean).</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/code/todo-app-language-switch.png" title="Language selection in the app" ></p>

<p>The actual selection is then stored in a simple cookie. This way, the
server knows the selected language in every request. I also reload the
page after setting the language. This reloads the angular application
with the new language.</p>

<p>The actual language setting in angular is done via a LanguageService</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app.service('LanguageService', ['$http', '$cookies', '$window', ($http, $cookies, $window) -&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  @setLanguage = (key) -&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    $cookies.language = key
</span><span class='line'>    $window.location.reload()
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  @currentLanguage = () -&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    $cookies.language or "en"
</span><span class='line'>])</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The service stores the current language in a cookie (don&rsquo;t forget to add
<code>ngCookies</code> as a dependency of your angular app!) and retrieves it
either from the cookie or defaults to <code>"en"</code>.</p>

<p>That Service is used by the view via a simple little controller
j</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app.controller('LanguageController', ['$scope', 'LanguageService', ($scope, LanguageService) -&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  $scope.language = LanguageService.currentLanguage()
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  $scope.updateLanguage = (language) -&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    LanguageService.setLanguage(language)
</span><span class='line'>])</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And finally the view (ignore the <code>implicit lang</code> for now &ndash; we&rsquo;ll come to
that):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>@(implicit lang: Lang)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;navbar-right&quot;</span> <span class="na">ng-controller=</span><span class="s">&quot;LanguageController&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;select</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;language&quot;</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;language&quot;</span> <span class="na">ng-model=</span><span class="s">&quot;language&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;option</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;en&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>English (@Messages(&quot;language.select.en&quot;))<span class="nt">&lt;/option&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;option</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;de&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Deutsch (@Messages(&quot;language.select.de&quot;))<span class="nt">&lt;/option&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;option</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">&quot;ja&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>日本語 (@Messages(&quot;language.select.ja&quot;))<span class="nt">&lt;/option&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/select&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">ng-click=</span><span class="s">&quot;updateLanguage(language)&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>              @Messages(&quot;language.select.button&quot;)
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The relevant parts in the view are the <code>ng-model</code> directive on the
select element. The controllers sets that to the current language from
the service. And finally the button that triggers the language update
via its <code>ng-click</code> directive.</p>

<h2>Locale specific formatting</h2>

<p>The way angular handles locale specific formatting is via a locale specific JavaScript file
that is either included separately or concatenated to the end of the
actual angular.js file. While this approach works, it is not possible to
change the formatting on the fly. But since we reload the angular
application on language changes anyway, this is ok for us. The actual
include on the server now looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;@routes.Assets.at(&quot;</span><span class="na">javascripts</span><span class="err">/</span><span class="na">angular</span><span class="err">.</span><span class="na">js</span><span class="err">&quot;)&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;@routes.Assets.at(&quot;</span><span class="na">javascripts</span><span class="err">/</span><span class="na">angular-locale_</span><span class="err">&quot;</span> <span class="err">+</span> <span class="na">lang</span><span class="err">.</span><span class="na">language</span> <span class="err">+</span> <span class="err">&quot;.</span><span class="na">js</span><span class="err">&quot;)&quot;</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Where <code>lang</code> is a <code>play.api.i18n.Lang</code> object representing the current
language used for the request on the server (more on that later). That
way the angular application is always running with the language set by
the user and correctly reinitialized on language switching.</p>

<p>Since my todo app would not actually make use of any of this, I&rsquo;ve simply added
a footer that shows todays date formatted by angular. (Therefore my
application gained a neat feature: If you ever need todays date in
Japanese for whatever reason, just use my todo app).</p>

<h2>Translated templates</h2>

<p>The actual meat of the i18n happens on the server. All the templates are
translated by Play!. Play! has a very nice way of dealing with
different languages. All supported languages must be declared in the
<code>application.conf</code> like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>application.langs=&quot;en,de,ja&quot;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The actual translations are stored in files called <code>messages.XXX</code> where
<code>XXX</code> is the language as declared previously. For all practical intents
and purposes, those files behave exactly like Javas <code>.properties</code> files
with one critical difference. Play! actually expects those files to be
in UTF-8 (There goes the need for my <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/Escapist">escapist</a>).</p>

<p>And now it&rsquo;s finally time to come the implicit language parameter that
we already saw in the language switch view.</p>

<p>The way you access those messages files is via a call to
<code>Messages("propery.key")</code>. This method also takes an implicit parameter
of type  <code>play.api.i18n.Lang</code>. So all we have to do is fetch the
language from the cookie, transform it into a valid <code>Lang</code> and pass it
to our templates.</p>

<p>In Play! template files are a weird mix of HTML and Scala code that is
actually compiled (and type checked at compile time!) into a regular
function that you call from your server-side controllers. To declare,
that our template requires a <code>Lang</code> Parameter, that should be used as an
implicit, we have to start our template with a parameter declaration
like so:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>@(implicit lang: Lang)
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We already saw that in the language parameter view. The view is normal
HTML and everything that starts with an <code>@</code> is expected to be Scala
code. So we can now write <code>@Messages("propery.key")</code> everywhere in our
template and it will magically choose the right language.</p>

<p>One word about Scalas implicits. They are a powerful feature of the language that can reduce a lot of
useless boilerplate code. However they are very close to magic and
should therefore be used with caution and only where really needed. If
in doubt, avoid implicits.</p>

<p>Finally, here is the trait I use to get the language out of the cookie
header:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>trait LocaleFromRequest {
</span><span class='line'>  def localeFromRequest(implicit request: RequestHeader): Lang = {
</span><span class='line'>    request.cookies.get(&quot;language&quot;) match {
</span><span class='line'>      case None =&gt; Application.lang(request)
</span><span class='line'>      case Some(cookie) =&gt; Lang.get(cookie.value).getOrElse(Application.lang(request))
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If there is no <code>language</code> key in the cookie, just use the Applications
default way of determining the language. Otherwise create a Lang from
the cookie-value. If that fails, fall back again to let play determine a
language from its known set of languages.</p>

<h2>Why don&rsquo;t you use the Accept-Language HTTP header?</h2>

<p>Good question. Because I want to give my users an easy way of changing
the application language. And changing the <code>Accept-Language</code> of your
browser is not at all easy or accessible to the common user.</p>

<h2>Pitfall: Bootstraps default fonts</h2>

<p>Bootstrap 3 by default has a font-family declaration of:</p>

<pre><code>font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
</code></pre>

<p>This is all nice and good on real systems. However on a default windows
box, there is neither &ldquo;Helvetica Neue&rdquo; nor Helvetica. And Arial
apparently has no full Japanese character support. The result are a visually very ugly mix of the different character classes
in Japanese.</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/code/app_jp.jpg" title="Application with ugly Japanese font rendering in Windows" ></p>

<p>See the obvious missmatch in width and serif-style of the の with respect to the other kanji?</p>

<p>Upon recommendation by Fabian Prinz, I&rsquo;ve added
some font to the mix that I&rsquo;ve never heard of before:</p>

<pre><code>font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, "MS PGothic", Arial, sans-serif;
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/code/app_jp-font.jpg" title="Application with better Japanese font rendering in Windows" ></p>

<p>Much better. Now even Japanese Windows Users can enjoy my awesome todo-list.</p>

<h2>Pitfall: JSON in Play! 2.1</h2>

<p>Play!-Scala has great support for working with JSON. But due to the fact that
Scala has a strong type-system and Play! 2.1 introduced some substantial
changes to the way JSON is handled, it might be a bit difficult to get
started (the <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.x/ScalaJson">documentation</a> is a bit thin and most examples in the web refer to the
old ways).</p>

<p>The basics for handling JSON is creating a reader and a writer. The
reader also doubles as a validator. The following is a reader for a ToDo
that parses the JSON string <code>{"name": "A Todo", "done": false, "id": 42}</code> with the little caveat that the id key is optional:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>implicit val toDoJsonReader = new Reads[ToDo] {
</span><span class='line'>  def reads(json: JsValue) = {
</span><span class='line'>    (json \ &quot;name&quot;).validate[String].flatMap { name =&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        (json \ &quot;done&quot;).validate[Boolean].map { done =&gt;
</span><span class='line'>          (json \ &quot;id&quot;).asOpt[Long] match {
</span><span class='line'>            case Some(id) =&gt; ToDo(Id(id), name, done)
</span><span class='line'>            case _ =&gt; ToDo(Id(0L), name, done)
</span><span class='line'>          }
</span><span class='line'>        }
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>While this is very straight forward and idiomatic Scala, it can be a bit
overwhelming for people new to Scala. It took me a while to really get
the hang of it.</p>

<p>However, the Reads object is then implicitly
used like in the following example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>def create = Action(parse.json) { request =&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    request.body.validate[ToDo].fold(
</span><span class='line'>      valid = todo =&gt; Ok(Json.toJson(ToDoService.createNew(todo))),
</span><span class='line'>      invalid = e =&gt; BadRequest(&quot;invalid request&quot;)
</span><span class='line'>    )
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Pitfall: Minification</h2>

<p>A well known pitfall in angular.js is the danger of JavaScript minifiers
to the dependency-injection mechanism of angular. It is therefore best
to get in the habit of using the more verbose array-syntax for
controllers even in CoffeeScript. So instead of writing</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>app.controller &#39;MyBrokenController&#39;, ($scope) -&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  $scope.value = &#39;will break in minification&#39;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Always write the long form, that survives minification:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>app.controller &#39;MyWorkingController&#39;, [&#39;$scope&#39;, ($scope) -&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  $scope.value = &#39;will work minified&#39;
</span><span class='line'>]
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Some words about the example</h2>

<p>The code for the application is over on <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/ang18n">GitHub</a>. Since I&rsquo;m
fairly new to Scala, it might not be the most idiomatic Scala (or Play!
for that matter). I also did not set up a real database. The todo list
uses the H2 in-memory DB even over on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>. So don&rsquo;t expect
your todos to stay there. I actually don&rsquo;t know when and whether heroku
restarts the application. But when they do, the in-memory database
will be cleared!</p>

<p>One other thing I kind of regret, when I started I was
on the fence of writing <em>todo</em> or <em>to-do</em>. The results are inconsequently
named Objects. Sometimes I used <code>todo</code> and sometimes <code>toDo</code>. This
inconsistency annoys me and If it wouldn&rsquo;t be so annoying to change only
the case of files in git under OS X, I would probably already have done
it. This proves once more, that there are only two hard problems in
computer science:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cache invalidation</li>
<li>Naming things</li>
<li>Off-by-one errors</li>
</ol>


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So is the combination of Play! and angular.js a good fit for
multi-language single-page applications? Absolutely! It is a breeze to
write a RESTful API with Play! Once you get a hang on the way Play!
handles JSON there is very little friction. And the templating system in
Play! is one of the best server side templates I&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>

<p>However there are also downsides. My biggest gripe is with the asset
pipeline in Play! While on the first look it seems to be a very good
system with <a href="http://http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a> support out of
the box, it actually turned out to be not as flexible as I would have
wished. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not smart enough but I was not able to get Play!
to execute <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> Test Specs
written in <a href="http://http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>. And no testing in angular.js means,
you are missing out on one of the other great features of angular.</p>

<p>On the last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-Berlin-Brandenburg/">Play! Usergroup Meetup in Berlin</a>
was a presentation by my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/simon_yann">Yann Simon</a> showing how
to use <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> instead of the asset pipeline in
Play! I would recommend to use that for real projects as it provides
more flexibility in asset handling, is a technology known to many
front-end developers and provides an even cleaner separation between the
GUI/front-end and the server/back-end.</p>

<p>One more thing. Writing angular.js in <a href="http://http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a> is a great
pleasure! The more friendly syntax of CoffeeScript really helps a lot
and makes the code much more readable.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>One important thing that I havn&rsquo;t yet looked into is caching. Currently,
there is the real danger of browsers caching the templates and therefore
not updating correctly to a language switch. The easy (and ugly) way out would be
to just disable caching on all html files. A better approach would be to
add the language as query- or url-parameter to give the browser a chance to cache
the files for every language separately.</p>

<p>There should also be a way to set the language via a URL to make it

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Hops Coffee]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/12/11/hops-coffee/"/>
<updated>2012-12-11T16:34:00+01:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/12/11/hops-coffee</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, we&rsquo;ve been to Qingdao (青岛). Qingdao is quite often also referred to by its <em>german</em> name-mangling Tsingtao. Tsingtao happens to be the biggest brewer and beer exporter in China and therefore also one of the largest in the world (Chinas economy of scale at work here).</p>

<p>Therefore it can&rsquo;t come as a huge surprise, that Qingdao features a rather nice beer museum. The history of the brewery and the old as well as the current brewing equipment is on display along with a bar for tasting and of course a gift shop with lot&rsquo;s of souvenirs. Some more related to beer than others.</p>

<p>The one, that really caught my eye was <em>Hops Coffee</em>. The direct combination of my two most favorite beverages in the world can&rsquo;t be recommended at all. But the idea of a slight hops aroma in a nice cup of coffee sounds at least interesting to me.</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/HopsCoffee.jpg" title="&#34;Hops Coffee, brewed and ready to drink&#34;" alt="&#34;Hops Coffee, brewed and ready to drink&#34;"></p>

<p>Sadly, the actual product was more of a multi stage disappointment than a great new beverage. First, it&rsquo;s instant. I can live with that and was kind of expecting it to be.</p>

<p>Second, the instant mix also includes sweeteners (<em>yuck</em>) and milk powder, ruining an otherwise perfectly good instant coffee.</p>

<p>And then, there is the actual Hops. Or better yet, the lack of it. The hops aroma exists purely by the power of your mind. It is so weak, that after my first cup, I searched the box to see if the hops aroma might be in another sachet. It isn&rsquo;t. If you concentrate hard and really want to smell some hops it is just barely there. But nothing more.…</p>

<p>All in all, the hops coffee was rather disappointing. It is a sweetened, whitened, otherwise boring instant coffee. However, I&rsquo;ll probably get hold of some actual hops for proper brewing some time early next year. I&rsquo;ll use that to make some proper hops coffee. Brewed from good beans and otherwise black as coffee is intended to be. Looking forward to see how that turns out…</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Bastion]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/11/16/bastion/"/>
<updated>2012-11-16T16:36:00+01:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/11/16/bastion</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/TheBastionLogo.jpg" title="Bastion Logo" ></p>

<p>Yesterday, I finally finished my second play through of Bastion. The game is so great, that I want to recommend it here.</p>

<h3>Story</h3>

<p>On first sight, The Bastion appears to be little more than a flying peace of rock drifting through the remains of what the Calamity left of the old world. In the beginning of the game, The Bastion finds The Kid (or The Kid finds The Bastion). On the  Bastion, the Kid meets The Stranger and &ndash; guided by him &ndash; The Kid searches the land to find other survivors and ultimately to uncover the secrets of the Calamity, that fractured the earth, destroyed Caelondia and left so few survivors.</p>

<p>When The Kid and The Stranger first met, the Bastion is weak and powerless. To bring her back to old glory, The Kid first has to search for the Cores, that are scattered throughout the land. With every Core that is recovered, the Bastion gains new Energy and grows, enabling them to travel much further into the lands.
Soon they realize, they are not the only ones who survived the Calamity. Other Survivors, like Zulf from the folk of the Ura, join them on the Bastion.</p>

<p>In the end, they figure out, what the Calamity actually was, what led to this huge catastrophe. A discovery, not everyone deals with equally&hellip;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>One could think of Bastion as a hack-n-slash RPG. You control The Kid and roam the world in an isometric top-down perspective. Battle in Bastion is realtime and The Kid gathers quite an arsenal of close-combat and long-range weapons. Throw in his Bullhead Shield and some special abilities and you are set. There is also some leveling involved, but apart from packing a bigger punch and more health, leveling up doesn&rsquo;t gain you much. So don&rsquo;t expect a Diablo-Style skill tree or anything.</p>

<p>Bastion started out as an Indie game on XBox Live but is now available on nearly everything that has a display. I&rsquo;ve played it on the iPad, but if you can, play it on something that has a bigger screen &ndash; Bastion is beautiful. Bastion is drawn in living, vibrant colors and has a comic-art-style that really hits my taste. It&rsquo;s meant to be played on your big screen TV, with the rocking volume from your speakers. But I&rsquo;ll get to the audio later.</p>

<p>The difficulty was quite right for me. I had no problem, finishing the game. The occasional death happened, but it never got frustrating. And if you like a challenge, the last few achievements are really hardcore (I haven&rsquo;t managed to finish any of the dreams with all 10 gods enabled. I already struggle with 5).</p>

<h3>The Bad</h3>

<p>Since we are on the go, it was most convenient for me to play Bastion on the iPad. The iPad is really great for recreational gaming. Melt with a couch or a comfy chair, pop in your favorite headphones and dive into the space between your hands.
However a touchscreen isn&rsquo;t the perfect input device for games like bastion. While it did get the job done most of the time, a real gamepad would have been a lot better. It is just too easy to hit the wrong touch-area (aka button) in  busy moment and do a barrel roll into the abyss instead of pushing the enemy into the same.</p>

<p>So, the touchscreen controls, while being ok, have to go into the bad section. Along with the german localization. Luckily they just translated onscreen texts and added subtitles. Yet, I would have preferred having the game the way it was intended to be. But I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to switch the language on my iPad although my entire iPad is set to english anyways. So either I am too stupid or the lack of a language switch has to be my biggest complaint about Bastion.
Really, that is my biggest complaint about the game. That I couldn&rsquo;t set it to another language. The game itself, I have nothing to complain about.</p>

<p>I could imagine, that some people might complain about replay-value. To be honest, once you&rsquo;ve finished the game a second time, there is not much left to do. The story has been told. The secrets are uncovered. There is not a lot left to pull you back into the game afterwards. But I consider that a plus. I am no student anymore and my time for games is scarce. I like it, when a game has a clear cut ending and I can put it away and move on. Nothing worse than those kind of games, that hook you up and never ever let you go again.</p>

<h3>The Good</h3>

<p>So the length of the game goes into The Good. The story had me hooked from the get go and unfolded at a great pace. You get a good value out of your buck. The game is usually priced between 10 and 20 $ and goes on different sales or bundles from time to time. And for that, you get many hours of fun gameplay, a great story and an atmosphere that will hook you right in.</p>

<p>A big part of that atmosphere are the beautiful visuals. Bastion looks great with living colors and fluid animations. The whole world feels alive.</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/TheBastion.jpg" title="The Bastion, injured but still strong." ></p>

<p>Another equally big part is the music. Bastion has one of the best soundtracks I&rsquo;ve heard in a game for a long time (although this doesn&rsquo;t really mean a lot considering how much I game these days). It&rsquo;s often dominated by acoustic guitars and strings, has a great beat and sometimes drifts a bit into the oriental space. The music perfectly underlines what is happening on the screen and you really want to turn it up. The soundtrack can even stand on its own. I have to admit, that the soundtrack had many rotations in my playlist long, long before I actually played the game. Bastion even manages to sneak in a few songs with lyrics in certain areas of the game &ndash; lyrics… in a game!</p>

<p>I guess, whether you like this game or not boils down to whether you like the story and atmosphere. If they don&rsquo;t get you hooked, you probably won&rsquo;t like the game as much as I did. Yeah, it is fun. It is fun walking around and engaging in battle. It is fun getting new weapons and leveling them up. It feels great to counter block an enemy and than smash him in the ground. But if you are not hooked into the story, you&rsquo;ll probably put the controller aside sooner than later. From a pure gameplay-perspective, there are probably a few better hack-n-slash RPGs.</p>

<p>But this one has a twist. A catch, that the others don&rsquo;t have. A nugget of awesome.</p>

<h3>The Awesome</h3>

<p>Two words: Logan Cunningham. It is quite a challenge writing so much about Bastion without mentioning Logan Cunningham until this point. Logan is the voice actor of Rucks, The Stranger. And with his smokey, rough voice, he comments and narrates the entire story from beginning to end. And this is Bastions unique and awesome twist. Most games tell their story between the Levels, advancing it via cutscenes and the like. But in Bastion, there is a story teller,  a narrator. He is telling you a story; the story you are just playing. And it works. It works beautifully. Even though there is rarely a minute where Rucks is not narrating what is happening on the screen, it never feels repetitive or out of place. The only downside of this is, the game is very linear. You don&rsquo;t have a lot of choice how to advance next.</p>

<p>Trust me, just writing/reading this doesn&rsquo;t give it justice. You have to hear and see it in action.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>As you might have guessed, I enjoyed Bastion a lot. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to tell the world about it. I give it   ★★★★★ without hesitation. I know, I&rsquo;m a bit late to the party (at least, Bastion isn&rsquo;t <a href="http://xkcd.com/606/">5 years</a> old by now). Bastion was first released well over a year. So you have no excuse as well. If you like games with some action at all, you should at least give it a try. So, if you don&rsquo;t yet own a copy, head over to your favorite digital store and get it. I recommend making sure to get the Soundtrack as well. As I said, it can easily stand on its own as a cool tune.</p>

<p>If you give it a try, let me know, how you liked it!</p>

<p>Turn up the volume all the way to eleven, take your Breaker&rsquo;s Bow and your Cael Hammer and let the Bastion guide your way. <em>Ain&rsquo;t much Kid can&rsquo;t handle with Hammer and Bow in hand.</em></p>

<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/11/15/opportunities-of-scale</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We tend to forget how huge China is. Yeah, China is big and there are many Chinese. But how <em>many</em> Chinese there are, just needs a reminder from time to time.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+china+vs+eu">Wolfram Alpha</a>, the population of china was estimated to be 1.3 billion in 2010. That is easily more, than the population of the EU and the USA combined.</p>

<p>This has a some peculiar consequences. For once, there are quite a few multi-million citizen cities, you&rsquo;ve likely never heard of before. Would you know, where to search for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoukou">Zhoukou</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linyi">Linyi</a> on the map? They both have a population of around 10 Million &ndash; give or take.</p>

<p>Another interesting consequence, there are a lots of hugely popular services and companies, that you have also probably never heard of &ndash; some of them more interesting than others.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> equivalent of China for example is <a href="http://weibo.com">Sina Weibo</a>. While being mostly unknown in the western world, Weibo is about the same size as Twitter. According to the wikipedia, Twitter has currently about 500 million users and generates about 340 million messages a day. The 3 year old Weibo currently has about 368 million users and generates 100 million messages a day &ndash; not as much but the same order of magnitude (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">source</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo">source</a>).</p>

<p>Just as Weibo is quite similar to Twitter, there are many other china-only competitors to the services, we know. Yesterday, we used a very neat one. The site is called <a href="http://www.360buy.com/">360buy.com</a> (Strangely, many of the Chinese alternatives use .com instead of .cn TLDs). From the looks of it, they appear to be a competitor to <a href="http://www.amazon.de/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;site-redirect=de&amp;tag=notadomaincom-21">amazon</a>. Yet, 360buy has a cool feature: In many areas, including Beijing, they offer <em>same-day-delivery</em>. For free. Just like that.</p>

<p>We decided, we needed to get a cheep DVD player for the TV in our apartment. We went to 360buy, used Chrome to translate the page, chose a device, entered our address and clicked on order. This was around 9:00 am. The same day at around 5:00 pm, it knocked on the door. We payed in cash and got our DVD player.</p>

<p>The whole experience was fast, friendly and due to Chromes page translate-feature, even possible for lazy aliens, that don&rsquo;t speak Chinese.</p>

<p>Part of me wants that from amazon <em>(in Germany)</em>!</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Small Differences: Money]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/11/10/small-differences-money/"/>
<updated>2012-11-10T12:24:00+01:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/11/10/small-differences-money</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of course china uses money like everywhere else. And a lot of payments are done using cash. But the cash here is a bit different than in Europe.</p>

<p>This mainly boils down to the fact, that the biggest bill available in china is the 100 RMB bill. This is currently worth roughly 12.50 €. All other bills are worth even less. Also, coins are used far less often and only go up to 1 RMB (about 0.12 €).</p>

<p>This has two interesting consequences. First: You always have a trousers pocket full of papermoney. A thick stack of bills which is worth about 10 €. I kind of like that. Far more comfy than having a pocket full of €-coins. And still worth so little, that you don&rsquo;t really care if you lose a bill. (I guess this is similar in the US with their 1 $ bill).</p>

<p>The second consequence is, whenever you have to pay for something a bit more expensive, you deal with huge stacks of money. Making you feel a bit like a gangster in the first moment and making you wish, you had a counting machine the moment after that. (Counting machines are extremely common in china. Basically every cash register has one).</p>

<p>Did I mention, we payed our entire 3 month rent and a safety deposit in cash? This is how some of it looked:</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Cash.jpg" title="Lots of cash" ></p>

<p>Really, you have to deal with silly big stacks of cash from time to time. You have to make multiple trips to an ATM to get reasonable amounts of cash because they can&rsquo;t spit out stacks big enough. Stuff like that.</p>

<p>Apparently there is also quite a lot of counterfeit money in the wild. The Chinese will always check 50 and 100 RMB bills for validity. Either by hand or by feeding it through a counting machine.</p>

<p>And there is also the other side of the value spectrum. The smallest bill in circulation (and not quite uncommon) is the 1 Yi Jiao bill, aka 0.1 RMB. So it is roughly worth 1 euro cent.</p>

<p>On the street, prices are usually multiples of 1 RMB. Amounts below 1 RMB are usually only found in supermarkets and similar stores. So you usually put your Yi Jiaos somewhere and hope to remember theme the next time you are grocery shopping.</p>

<p>This is how it looks:</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/worthless.jpg" title="Worthless money" ></p>

<p>It has roughly the same size and feel as monopoly money. Only, it is worth slightly less then monopoly money.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Small differences: Prepaid]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/10/29/small-differences/"/>
<updated>2012-10-29T18:37:00+01:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/10/29/small-differences</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been in Beijing for over a month by now. After that time I feel quite confident in saying, that Beijing is just another big city. It is quite <em>western</em> and very big. If you look at it from a high enough level, it is very similar to other big cities. There is public transportation. People have jobs. There is a large middle class. People buy designer clothes in huge malls. Just the usual.</p>

<p>It is the same shit like home, albeit <em>some</em> things are different. If you zoom in close enough, you can see lots of small differences. In the way, the city works, the society works. Really, it&rsquo;s all over the place. In the <em>Small Differences</em> series of posts, I plan to point out those differences, I found noticeable.</p>

<h1>Small Differences: Prepaid</h1>

<p>Having a prepaid cell phone is a very common thing here in Beijing like in many other big cities all around the globe. However, cell phones are not the only thing coming as prepaid variant over here. A few days ago, we had to find out, that also gas, water and electricity are often prepaid in China. And how do you discover something like that? Of course by standing under the shower and enjoying a lack of warm water. We complained to the landlord and low and behold &ndash; the next day someone came with a smart card, shoved it somewhere into the gas-meter and everything was fine again.</p>

<p>They also showed us the cards. This is a bit useless since we have no idea at all how to recharge those cards. But I can at least show them here. In order from top to bottom: Water, electricity and gas.</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Prepaid.jpg"></p>

<p>If you think about it, it actually isn&rsquo;t that bad of an idea. At least people can&rsquo;t get in situations, where they all of a sudden have to repay huge sums because they used more gas then anticipated.</p>

<p>I will write about heating here another time. There is a small difference to heating as well, although it is not prepaid like gas, water and electricity.</p>

<updated>2012-10-11T16:49:00+02:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/10/11/take-a-deep-breath</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks before we started our journey, a friend of mine gave me a
link to an article in the german Tagesspiegel (<a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/leben-in-china-dicke-luft-in-peking-/6848760.html">link</a>). The author of that article stayed a while in Beijing as well. And according to her, the quality of the air in Beijing is usually so bad,
it took the author over a week to realize that her apartment had a view
on the mountains.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Beijing, we had a clear blue sky. So naturally, I was
thinking the author exaggerated a bit. That is, until yesterday, when I
realized that our apartment had a view on the mountains as well. It took
us <em>just</em> five days to realize that.</p>

<p>I took a picture from our window that morning. Today – also a nice
day with lots of sun – I tried to take the same picutre again. Same ISO, same
aperture, same shutter speed, roughly the same time of the day. I merged those images. This is the result:</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Airquality.jpg" title="Overlay of a clear and a usual day" ></p>

<p>To be honest, I made one mistake. I let the camera on
auto-white-balance. This probably overstates the difference a bit.
Anyways, take a deep breath and enjoy.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Elevator Rushhour]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/10/08/elevator-rushhour/"/>
<updated>2012-10-08T09:35:00+02:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/10/08/elevator-rushhour</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning, we encountered something, I didn&rsquo;t knew existed: <em>Elevator
Rushhour</em>. I&rsquo;ve never lived in a 28 story building before. We now live
on the 21st floor. If every floor is roughly the same as ours, there are 12
apartments on each floor.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>=&gt; (* 28 12)
</span><span class='line'>; 336</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So there are a good 300 apartments. The building currently has three working elevators.
Even if we assume that not every
apartment is inhabited and not every inhabitant has to get up in
the morning to get to work, this leaves us with a lot of people that
need to exit the building in a narrow timeframe.</p>

<p>We left at 8:00. And we waited for nearly 10 minutes to finally leave the
building. The elevators were all basically stopping at every other floor
on their way down. Then going all the way up again only to repeat the
stop and go on their way down.</p>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/map.jpg" title="'A map of the places where we took pictures'" ></p>

<p>We have arrived in Beijing and I could already write a lot about it. But I won&rsquo;t do that now because I don&rsquo;t want all of our Russia impressions to get lost in time and memory. This post is intended two give a rather brief overview about our time there (but fails to be brief). More detailed stories are following soon (I hope).</p>

<!--more-->


<h1>Москва</h1>

<p>We arrived in the late afternoon in Moscow Domodedovo and proceeded to the German embassy to meet a friend of A. We grossly underestimated the time it took us to get there. Moscow is <em>huge</em>! And busy like hell during rush hour. And I mean seriously busy. And huge. Berlin is tiny and calm compared to Moscow at rush hour.</p>

<p>Nonetheless we had a very nice evening in Moscow with some beer, квас and great Ukrainian food (don&rsquo;t ask). The next day, we did the usual sight seeing before getting our bags out of the embassy and going back to Domodedovo to catch our plane to Irkutsk. All in all, our Moscow trip was short and intense, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. One thing about Domodedovo: guys, broken and rotten airplanes are not the best decoration for an airport. It creates nervous feelings.</p>

<h1>Lake Baikal</h1>

<p><img class="right" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mapyz7GE9q1rgtzh1o1_500.jpg" width="350" title="'Blurry Irkutsk'" ></p>

<p>This marks the start of an amazing, yet exhausting week in Siberia. We arrived in Иркутск (Irkutsk) before sunrise, somehow managed to get on a trolley bus to the center and walked the rest to the hostel, at which we intended to stay a week later. At the hostel, we woke the poor lady in charge that day, dropped off some of our baggage, we wouldn&rsquo;t need in Russia and left again. Without sleep or real breakfast, we moved to the ferry port to take the boat to Листвянка (Lystvyanka) &ndash; at least that was the plan. However the boat was already sold out. This was a bit off a downer.</p>

<p>
<img class="left" src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Lystvyanka.jpg" width="350" title="'Lystvyanka'" >

We were not the only ones who were in this sad situation. There were two Russian couples in their early thirties with their children who wanted to go to Lystvyanka as well. It is safe to say there was a slight language barrier between us. They decided to go there by Маршгутка (Marschrutka) instead of the boat and kindly offered to take us along. Although it took them and us a while to communicate that.

If you&#8217;ve never been in a Marschrutka before, this can be a bit scary and it absolutely deserves a post of its own. Lets just say, it was a relief to do it together with locals for the first time. 
About an hour later we arrived in Lystvyanka - sleep deprived and tired. This might add up to the fact that we were a bit disappointed about it. Lake Baikal is beautiful! But Lystvyanka is a rather boring tourist trap for Russians. And off-season there really wasn&#8217;t that much to do or see. Somehow we were expecting more. 
</p>


<p>Therefore we changed our plan a bit and got on the ferry to Port Baikal on the opposite side of the River Ангара (Angara). The ferry looked a bit&hellip; Let&rsquo;s call her battle proven.</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ferry.jpg" title="'Ferry to Port Baikal'" ></p>

<p>Port Baikal also deserves its own entry. A long time ago it must have been a thriving place – a key port to the Trans Siberian Express. Now it is just a shadow of its former self. But it has a calm, melancholic beauty and is a good place to start short hikes. We stayed there for two nights, had a great time and met some wonderful people who are now new friends of ours (Ivan &amp; Mascha).</p>

<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maulaqXJB41rgtzh1o1_1280.jpg" title="View from over Port Baikal" ></p>

<p>In Port Baikal we also discovered that our original plan of going directly to Слюдянка (Sludyanka) via train was not feasible. The time schedule of the trains is a bit weird. So we went back to Lystvyanka via ferry, took another Marschrutka (this time on our own) to Irkutsk and stayed there for an unplanned night.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cat%20galina.jpg" width="350" title="'Galinas Cat'" ></p>

<p>After we arrived in Irkutsk, we must have looked a bit lost because a lady, that was on the same Marschrutka asked us if we might need help. Turned out, she was German and lived in the area for a while now. She recommended us a nice pension (Pension Galina), called there to make sure, they have room for us and told us the way. Then she disappeared. We were very thankful (and lucky) we met her. The pension was very nice. Galina herself looks a bit like a friendly witch. She lives in an old, wooden house with a beautiful cat and makes amazing влини for breakfast. And she even talks a bit German.</p>

<p>After our first shower in days and a good night of sleep, we left her in the early morning to take the regional train to Sludyanka.</p>

<p>At the train station, two young Americans (?) approached us: “do you speak English?” We said yes. “Very good! Here, this says&hellip;” At that point we interrupted them and told them, we don&rsquo;t really speak Russian. Did we really already looked like locals to them? We tried anyway but couldn&rsquo;t really help them. They had some sort of trouble getting their preordered train ticket. I hope they somehow figured it out.</p>

<h1>Siberian Taiga</h1>

<p>We went to Sludyanka in order to hike up to Пик Черского (peak Cherskogo) and see lake heart. It is said to be good for a young couple to see lake heart together. I guess we are on the safe side now because in the end we did manage to see the lake. However we would not have made it without the help of two other nice people we met in Sludyanka.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/lake%20heart.jpg" width="350" title="'Lake Heart'" ></p>

<p>Since we arrived in Sludyanka too late to start the hike the same day, we stayed for a night at the local mineral museum that also has a guest house. We asked them whether it is possible to get up to the peak and back down on the same day. Apparently it has been done before but it requires top physical condition. We decided to try.</p>

<p>In the evening however two middle aged men also arrived there: Andrei and Nikolai. They had a slightly longer hike planned than ours (with a much more relaxed time schedule). But the peak was their first stop as well. They offered to take us along with them. And they assured us that there is a base camp were we could sleep (even without a sleeping bag). We agreed to join them and spend the following night together with them at the camp.</p>

<p><img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/basecamp.jpg" title="'View from the Basecemp'" ></p>

<p>Nikolai is a professional guide in the area and his skills were very useful. The next day started rainy which would quickly turn into snowy as we progressed. And hiking in Russia is different. The trail is not really marked. You can see where people usually walk and that is it. No painted trees or rocks like on European routes. And with a few cm of snow, it is very easy to loose the trail. But Nikolai knew the area very well and got us safely to the Base camp.</p>

<p>The two days with Nikolai and Andrei are also worth a separate post. In short, we managed to get to the lake together. However A. and myself sadly had to turn around a few hundred meters before we could reach the actual peak to get back to Sludyanka in the evening.</p>

<h1>TransSib</h1>

<p><img class="right" src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ulan%20head.jpg" width="350" title="'Ulan Udes head'" ></p>

<p>We had to make it back down that day because we had tickets to a 2nd class sleeping car in the trans sib to Улан Уле (Ulan Ude). The train departed around midnight local time. If you ever get to take a train in Russia, be aware: times are always announced in Moscow time &ndash; no matter where and in which time zone you are!</p>

<p>The sleeping car was quite pleasant and we had a four person cabin just for us. We even managed to get a few hours of sleep. In Ulan Ude, we did the usual sight seeing. Learned a bit about buriat culture and visited a Buddhist temple. After some buriat food in the evening, we got to the station again to catch another train the same evening back to Irkutsk. But this time in 3rd class. Lets just say, the difference is obvious and the ride was not as pleasant as the first one.</p>

<h1>Irkutsk &ndash; finally</h1>

<p><img class="right" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb4bbgAKhA1rgtzh1o1_500.jpg" width="350" title="'Irkutsk Airport'" ></p>

<p>We arrived late in the night (~ 2:00), got to the hostel where our baggage was stored, took the second shower in Siberia and slept. We slept well and long.</p>

<p>After we finally got up and had a little breakfast &ndash; nah&hellip; lunch &ndash; at a wonderful small place that had tasty local food, some culture: the local art museum which claims to be the biggest in Siberia. Later in the afternoon, we met Ivan and Mascha again and spent some great time together. They showed us a bit around in Irkutsk. We went to a fire jugglers spectacle and finally settled down in a local brewpub (!!!) that had a few really good beers! (I have to tag it in open street map soon so it&rsquo;ll show up in the openbrewpub map). In the end, we said goodbye at the Аеропорт around 23.30 and tried to check in to our flight to Beijing. If you ever get to Irkutsk, be aware, the Аеропорт and the Airport are different buildings! However, they are right next to each other. One is for domestic and the other for international flights.</p>

<h1>Take away</h1>

<p>In the end, we both agree, that we had a very exhausting but wonderful time in Siberia. The nature is breathtakingly beautiful. Surprisingly similar to german nature but on a much bigger scale. You can see up to the horizon without a trace of human constructions. If you enjoy hiking, consider visiting the Baikal area! However, without A.’s sparse Russian skills we would have had problems &ndash; basic understanding of the Russian language is a requirement in the area.</p>

<p>Another thing that is very different: the extreme temperature difference between day and night. The afternoons were usually very fit for t shirts. However as soon as the sun set, temperature fell quickly below zero. The upside: no moskitos. This makes the Siberian autumn a great time for a visit!</p>

<p>One more thing must be mentioned: the people in the area! Each and every one of the people (except one &ndash; who was very drunk), we had direct interactions with in Siberia were extremely kind, friendly and tried to help us as much as possible. In that sense: thanks to everyone and до свидания!</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Berlin → Москва → Иркутск → 北京 → ???]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/09/11/big-travel/"/>
<updated>2012-09-11T21:20:00+02:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/09/11/big-travel</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_madug76njY1rgtzh1o1_1280.jpg" title="'Ready to go on a tour'" ></p>

<p>On thrusday, in just a few short days, we will start quite a big travel.
First stop will be Moscow, where we stay for a day before we head on to
lake baikal for a week of hiking and vacation.</p>

<p>Next stop will be china. <em>A.</em> will be doing an internship in Beijing
starting in October and I will give her company as long as I&rsquo;m permitted
to stay in China. Sadly it is not possible to stay in China as a tourist
for as long as an intern.</p>

<p>When my permission to stay in China expires, we will have to part our
ways for a few weeks. I will move on to South Korea and Japan (and maybe
some more places where I don&rsquo;t need a complicated visa).</p>

<p>At the end of december, we will rejoin at beijing airport to fly back
home together. Or at least that is the plan.</p>

<p>All of this is surely going to be very exciting and we are looking
forward to it a lot (although from time to time a bit nervously). Did I
mention, we don&rsquo;t really speak any chinese language?</p>

<p>As a result of our travels, over the next few weeks and months, the focus of
this blog might shift a bit away from technical topics over to
documenting our travels.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m not sure about the conditions of the intertube access along
the way, this might be more or less complicated. I might have trouble
posting to this blog, therefore I&rsquo;ve also set up accounts over at
<a href="http://mo-gr.tumblr.com">tumblr</a> and <a href="http://mo-gr.posterous.com">posterous</a>.
And be sure to also follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mo_gr">twitter</a> if
you want to stay up to date.</p>

<p>We will post pictures and status updates to at least one of those places
in a semi regular fashion.</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Type Hints]]></title>
<link href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/04/16/type-hints/"/>
<updated>2012-04-16T22:59:00+02:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/04/16/type-hints</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, <a href="mana">Matthias Naber</a> made me aware of <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> type hints in JSF and JSP files.</p>

<p><a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> does quite a good job in figuring out the types of EL variables itself, providing code completion and usage information. But there are situations where <a href="idea">IDEA</a> is unable determine the type of an EL variable. This usually occurs to me in a facelet <code>composition</code> where the variables are passed in as a <code>param</code>.</p>

<p>The following is a basic facelt composition invocation:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ui:include src="toiletten.xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;ui:param name="toilette" value="#{umkleide.toiletten}"/&gt;
&lt;/ui:include&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the file containing the invocation, <a href="idea">IDEA</a> is fully aware of the type of the EL variables. However in the included file (toiletten.xhtml), which might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html" 
  xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"&gt;
  &lt;ui:composition&gt;
    &lt;h:outputLabel value="#{toilette.ppBecken}"/&gt;
  &lt;/ui:composition&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> is unable to infere the type of the EL variable <code>toilette</code>. It is therefore neither able to offer me code completion nor warn me about typos and errors. It might even mark the getter <code>getPpBecken()</code> in the Toilette as unused.</p>

<p>However, if you help <a href="idea">IDEA</a> a little bit by hinting the type, all the goodness is restored. Just add the following, proprietary comment somewhere in the file:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;!--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This comment tells <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> the type of the EL variable, enabling autocompletion, usage indexing and of course only marking true errors in the file.</p>

<p>If you are using JSPs, the comment should probably look something like:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;%--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are somehow worried about putting proprietary comments in your files, <em>you</em> have some weird issues. But nonetheless, those comments, at least in facelets, even work outside of the <code>composition</code>-tag, which will make them become ignored anyway.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html" 
  xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"&gt;
  &lt;!--@elvariable id="toilette" type="com.notadomain.datamodel.Toiletten"--&gt;
  &lt;ui:composition&gt;
    &lt;h:outputLabel value="#{toilette.ppBecken}"/&gt;
  &lt;/ui:composition&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A properly configured <a href="idea">IntelliJ</a> setup will help you so many times a day. You are going to be a <em>lot</em> more productive. It is absolutely worth, adding some comments and guides to make the warnings and analyzations of your IDE more precise and focussed.</p>

<p>If I had gotten a coin for every time, I fixed a bug, that was already underlined and critized by <a href="idea">IDEA</a> when I found it, I&rsquo;d have an aweful lot of coins.</p>

<p>Use your tools to their full advance and don&rsquo;t check in code that contains warnings! I really wish, there would be something like the <code>-Werror</code> flag in <code>javac</code>!</p>

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Berlin Expert Days]]></title>

<updated>2012-03-31T16:39:00+02:00</updated>
<id>http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/2012/03/31/berlin-expert-days</id>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This years <a href="http://bed-con.org/">Berlin Expert Days</a> conference has come to an end. The <a href="http://bed-con.org/">BEDCon</a> is a small tech conference in, you
guessed it, Berlin. The focus is somewhere around the Java ecosystem but it is no LASER sharp focus.</p>

<p>This years <a href="http://bed-con.org/">BEDCon</a> was full of high quality talks and interesting attendies. The conference sold out with somewhere
around 350 people and although some talks were a bit crowded, the atmosphere was very nice and friendly! Thanks to everyone who
contributed in one way or another! I had a great time.</p>

<h2>Why Coffee is good for developers</h2>

<p>This was the first conference, where I attended as a speaker. I gave a (hopefully) entertaining introduction to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> on
the second day titled <a href="http://bed-con.org/talks/why-coffee-is-good-for-developers/">Why Coffee is good for developers</a>. And judging by the feedback I got in person and via twitter, the talk was a huge success. Thanks to
everyone who attended! I hope you had as much fun listening as I had giving the talk!</p>

<p>I opened my talk with some facts about actual coffee as a pun on the title of the talk before spinning into
<a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> and the problems, it tries to solve. Some people told me, they liked the idea and also enjoyed my
facts about coffee. Although one person aparently didn&rsquo;t liked it at all. He left before I even got to the interesting
parts probably thinking, I was talking about coffee for an hour. Maybe he is more of a tea guy :)</p>

<h2>HTML slides are gaining traction</h2>

<p>My <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/wcig4d">slides</a> are available online and the sources are on <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/wcig4d">github</a> too (Sorry, slides are in german.) The slides work best in Safari but should also work in Chrome. Non-WebKit Browsers are probably going to have some problems. Since a few people have asked me, I made the
slides with my own custom fork of the fabulous <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a>. I rewrote it in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> and modified it quite a
bit for this presentation. If you plan to use it, at this moment, I have to recomment using <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a> over my fork. I
plan to put some more effort into my fork and iron out many of the wrinkles. But at the moment, <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a> is more
stable and more active. I&rsquo;ll post here when there are news about my fork.</p>

<p>I was by far not the only speaker with HTML slides. An intersting trend, that I really do appreciate. HTML slides tend
to be less bullet point ridden than powerpoint slides. The presentations are often more interactive and engaging. The slides are easier and faster to
share after the talk and they discourage the stupid idea of printing out slides. But as <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js">impress.js</a> calls out in its
readme, they &ldquo;may not help you if you have nothing interesting to say ;)&rdquo;</p>

<p>One other framework for HTML slides, that looked very intersting was <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">reveal.js</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/spinscale">Alexander Reelsen</a> used it for his
slides and they looked great. But then again, he also hat something interesting to say&hellip;</p>

<p>If you have anything to do with the web at all, check out one of the options for HTML slides! Not only is it fun to
create the slides, it is also a nice exercise for your web-fu! And you can use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ</a> instead of PowerPoint for
creating slides &ndash; how awesome is that?!</p>

<h2>Flattr</h2>

<p>Over the weekend, I integrated <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into my blog. <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> is an
online payment system for giving small donations to content creators
over the internet. It is a neat way to <em>tip</em> people on the web. It
slowly gains some traction in Europe and many german content creators have it
integrated into their services. Even some newspapers like the german
<a href="http://taz.de">taz</a> integrate <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> to give users of their online portal an easy
way to voluntarily pay for news articles.</p>

<p>In the USA it is not that common yet. Although pages, like <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a>
started integrating flattr recently as well.</p>

<h2>Octopress integration</h2>

<p>For the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> Integration, I basically used a
solution by <a href="http://blog.simonszu.de">Simon Szustkowski</a> that I found
via google. His solution is very straight forward. He gave a detailed
description of it on his <a href="http://blog.simonszu.de/2012/02/flattr-fur-octopress/">blog</a>
(which is in german) and there is also an octopress fork with the
changes included over <a href="https://github.com/bascht/octopress/commit/e2591467af488bceb2ed058220865cc5111e4f3e#diff-1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Following that way, you get a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> button on every post. In addition to that,
I also created a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> button for the blog as a whole and added it to
the asides. My changes to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> can be seen
<a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/not-a-blog/commit/1408219062aa8aac81abf54431d5edcd638dff2b">here</a>.
They integrate Simons solution and my Button for the blog into one
commit to my blog repo.
The <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Thing for the blog must be created manually on the <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> homepage
and the URL to that thing must be put in your <code>_config.yml</code> under
<code>flattr_blog_thing</code>. If that configuration is set and the custom aside
is enabled in the <code>default_asides</code>, there will be a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Button in
the aside.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/2106894.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>{% if site.flattr_blog_thing %}
&lt;a class=&quot;FlattrButton&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot; rev=&quot;flattr;button:compact;&quot; href=&quot;{{ site.url }}&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.flattr_blog_thing }}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flattr this&quot; title=&quot;Flattr this&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/noscript&gt;
{% endif %}</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>All other changes are directly from Simons solution. when the
<code>flattr_user</code> is set in <code>_config.yml</code>, the flattr-api Javascript will be
included in the header <code>source/_include/custom/head.html</code>. This will
also conditionally include <code>flattr_button.html</code> in the sharing area below each
post <code>source/_includes/post/sharing.html</code>. The <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Things are
automatically generated by the <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> API when someone first clicks on
one of those buttons. (A <em>Thing</em> in Flattr-Lingo is something you can
give money to.)</p>

<h2>Official support?</h2>

<p>By the way, the currently <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/255#issuecomment-2566028">official stance</a> of <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is to not
integrate <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into the core of <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. <a href="https://github.com/imathis">Brandon</a> wants to keep <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>
lean and have only the essentials in the core &ndash; which I think is very
reasonable. Maybe there will be an official Flattr-pluign sometime in
the future. Until then, I hope this helps other people integrating <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into their
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> setups. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/about.html">contact</a>
me.</p>

<p>And if you havn&rsquo;t yet tried <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a>, go ahead and make the internet a
better place for everyone!</p>
