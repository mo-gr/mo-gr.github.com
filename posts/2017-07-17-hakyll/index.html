        <p>This blog is now powered by <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>. The previous version was based on <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which served me well. But I felt like I needed a change for changes sake.</p>
<p>Also, Hakyll offers far less features and is therefore conceptually a lot simpler. I hope, this will make me tinker with it a bit more and as a result make me not ignore this blog as much as I did in the last two years.</p>
