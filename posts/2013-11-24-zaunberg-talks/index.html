        <p>I finally get a chance to sit down and write a short post about the <a href="http://zaunberg-talks.de/berlin2013/">Zaunberg Talks</a> workshop day last monday. It was a lot of fun to give my AngularJS workshop to a great group of attendees!</p>
<p>From the feedback I got so far, everyone there – me included – had a great time. We had some very interesting discussions along the way and I got some good ideas and suggestions to make it even more awesome the next time! Although, it was a lot more exhausting than I thought. At the end of the day my voice was close to collapsing and my brain was basically toast. I guess I’m not used to be the center of attention for a whole day :)</p>
<p>Anyways, a big <em>thank you</em> to everyone involved! The organization was flawless, the venue was professional (the wifi actually worked!) and it was especially nice that most of the attendees and speakers got together in the evening for beer, food and a chat. All in all a great day…</p>
<p>(Oh, by the way: Some impressions of the workshops are available at the <a href="http://zaunberg-talks.de/berlin2013/impressions">Zaunberg Talks website</a>.)</p>
