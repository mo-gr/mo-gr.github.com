        <p>I guess it’s time to make it official:</p>
<h3 id="i-am-now-a-freelancer">I am now a freelancer</h3>
<p>After years of constant employment, this is the first time I am standing on my own two feet. I’m still on the fence whether this is the best decision or biggest mistake in my career so far.</p>
<p>I greatly enjoyed working at <a href="http://www.spree.de">akquinet</a> for the last two and a half years. So, the decision to take this step was not an easy one. But I just have to do this personal experiment. I don’t want to look back at my life later on and regret never having tried this. The time is right and for the first few months I should be all set.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, here is some shameless self promotion: If you are looking for an experienced technical consultant to maneuver your JVM based project out of a tight corner – <a href="../../about.html#contact">contact me</a>. If you are looking for an excellent developer to help on your next kick-ass web application – <a href="../../about.html#contact">contact me</a>. If you need someone coaching your team to get up to speed on modern web technologies – <a href="../../about.html#contact">contact me</a>. And if you are actually looking for a highly motivated clojure developer – please, please <a href="../../about.html#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
