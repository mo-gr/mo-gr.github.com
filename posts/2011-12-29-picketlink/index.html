        <p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michaelschuetz">Michael</a> and myself have been hacking some features into a specific version of <a href="http://www.jboss.org/picketlink">picketlink</a>. An update to a newer version was out of the question. We blogged about it over <a href="http://blog.akquinet.de/2011/12/26/patching-picketlink-to-support-multiple-ldap-stores/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I really like to get my head around existing code bases. Finding my ways through them and fixing or modifing them. I should do that far more often!</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t want to rant too much about picketlink. It works most of the time. But man… there are some code smells in there. If I’m modifying a class somewhere down around line 3500-something, this is a smell. If a class needs more than 1000 LoC, it should probably not be a single class. DRY anyone? Enough of a rant… Our modifications aren’t really that much better. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_window_theory">Broken window theory</a> at work…</p>
