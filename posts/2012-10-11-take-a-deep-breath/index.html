    <section>
        <p>A few weeks before we started our journey, a friend of mine gave me a link to an article in the german Tagesspiegel (<a href="http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/leben-in-china-dicke-luft-in-peking-/6848760.html">link</a>). The author of that article stayed a while in Beijing as well. And according to her, the quality of the air in Beijing is usually so bad, it took the author over a week to realize that her apartment had a view on the mountains.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Beijing, we had a clear blue sky. So naturally, I was thinking the author exaggerated a bit. That is, until yesterday, when I realized that our apartment had a view on the mountains as well. It took us <em>just</em> five days to realize that.</p>
<p>I took a picture from our window that morning. Today – also a nice day with lots of sun – I tried to take the same picutre again. Same ISO, same aperture, same shutter speed, roughly the same time of the day. I merged those images. This is the result:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://com.notadomain.blogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Airquality.jpg" title="Overlay of a clear and a usual day" />

</div>
<p>To be honest, I made one mistake. I let the camera on auto-white-balance. This probably overstates the difference a bit. Anyways, take a deep breath and enjoy.</p>
