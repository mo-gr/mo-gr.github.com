        <p>Lazy me. Aparently it has been nearly two months since I last played with this blog. So instead of planing to tinker with it more and more, I decided to just go live.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So… here it is. I still have lots of plans what to do. I feel the strong urge to customize the default octopress design a bit. Maybe tweak it a bit here and there. My publishing workflow is also far from perfect. Right now, I deploy to an ec2 instance via rsync. I doubt, that this is the cheapest or fastest possible way. And I really want to automate something with dropbox so that I can create new posts from my iPad.</p>
<p>But if I finish all this before going live, I would probably never start this damn blog. I hope it will grow and flourish as I go with it.</p>
<p>The next few postings aren’t going to be about <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/blog/categories/meta/">meta-blogging</a> topics.</p>
<p>The basics are set up and running. I even added an <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/impressum.html">Impressum</a> to be a bit safer in the shark-infested minefield that the german internet is from a juristic stance.</p>
