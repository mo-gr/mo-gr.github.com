        <p><em>tl;dr:</em> <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/not-a-blog/commit/1408219062aa8aac81abf54431d5edcd638dff2b">Here</a> is how I integrated <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into my octopress blog.</p>

<h2 id="flattr">Flattr</h2>
<p>Over the weekend, I integrated <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into my blog. <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> is an online payment system for giving small donations to content creators over the internet. It is a neat way to <em>tip</em> people on the web. It slowly gains some traction in Europe and many german content creators have it integrated into their services. Even some newspapers like the german <a href="http://taz.de">taz</a> integrate <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> to give users of their online portal an easy way to voluntarily pay for news articles.</p>
<p>In the USA it is not that common yet. Although pages, like <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> started integrating flattr recently as well.</p>
<h2 id="octopress-integration">Octopress integration</h2>
<p>For the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> Integration, I basically used a solution by <a href="http://blog.simonszu.de">Simon Szustkowski</a> that I found via google. His solution is very straight forward. He gave a detailed description of it on his <a href="http://blog.simonszu.de/2012/02/flattr-fur-octopress/">blog</a> (which is in german) and there is also an octopress fork with the changes included over <a href="https://github.com/bascht/octopress/commit/e2591467af488bceb2ed058220865cc5111e4f3e#diff-1">here</a>.</p>
<p>Following that way, you get a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> button on every post. In addition to that, I also created a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> button for the blog as a whole and added it to the asides. My changes to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> can be seen <a href="https://github.com/mo-gr/not-a-blog/commit/1408219062aa8aac81abf54431d5edcd638dff2b">here</a>. They integrate Simons solution and my Button for the blog into one commit to my blog repo. The <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Thing for the blog must be created manually on the <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> homepage and the URL to that thing must be put in your <code>_config.yml</code> under <code>flattr_blog_thing</code>. If that configuration is set and the custom aside is enabled in the <code>default_asides</code>, there will be a <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Button in the aside.</p>
<p>{% gist 2106894 %}</p>
<p>All other changes are directly from Simons solution. when the <code>flattr_user</code> is set in <code>_config.yml</code>, the flattr-api Javascript will be included in the header <code>source/_include/custom/head.html</code>. This will also conditionally include <code>flattr_button.html</code> in the sharing area below each post <code>source/_includes/post/sharing.html</code>. The <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> Things are automatically generated by the <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> API when someone first clicks on one of those buttons. (A <em>Thing</em> in Flattr-Lingo is something you can give money to.)</p>
<h2 id="official-support">Official support?</h2>
<p>By the way, the currently <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/255#issuecomment-2566028">official stance</a> of <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is to not integrate <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into the core of <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. <a href="https://github.com/imathis">Brandon</a> wants to keep <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> lean and have only the essentials in the core - which I think is very reasonable. Maybe there will be an official Flattr-pluign sometime in the future. Until then, I hope this helps other people integrating <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a> into their <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> setups. If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="http://blog.notadomain.com/about.html">contact</a> me.</p>
<p>And if you havnâ€™t yet tried <a href="http://flattr.com">Flattr</a>, go ahead and make the internet a better place for everyone!</p>
