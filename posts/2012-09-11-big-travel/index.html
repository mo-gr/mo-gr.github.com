<p>On thrusday, in just a few short days, we will start quite a big travel. First stop will be Moscow, where we stay for a day before we head on to lake baikal for a week of hiking and vacation.</p>
<p>Next stop will be china. <em>A.</em> will be doing an internship in Beijing starting in October and I will give her company as long as I’m permitted to stay in China. Sadly it is not possible to stay in China as a tourist for as long as an intern.</p>
<p>When my permission to stay in China expires, we will have to part our ways for a few weeks. I will move on to South Korea and Japan (and maybe some more places where I don’t need a complicated visa).</p>
<p>At the end of december, we will rejoin at beijing airport to fly back home together. Or at least that is the plan.</p>
<p>All of this is surely going to be very exciting and we are looking forward to it a lot (although from time to time a bit nervously). Did I mention, we don’t really speak any chinese language?</p>
<p>As a result of our travels, over the next few weeks and months, the focus of this blog might shift a bit away from technical topics over to documenting our travels.</p>
<p>Since I’m not sure about the conditions of the intertube access along the way, this might be more or less complicated. I might have trouble posting to this blog, therefore I’ve also set up accounts over at <a href="http://mo-gr.tumblr.com">tumblr</a> and <a href="http://mo-gr.posterous.com">posterous</a>. And be sure to also follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/mo_gr">twitter</a> if you want to stay up to date.</p>
<p>We will post pictures and status updates to at least one of those places in a semi regular fashion.</p>
