<p>I’ve been using the same ssh public/private key for about 5 years and probably a minimum of three OS reinstalls.</p>
<p>Since that time, my personal password policy has changed. Gone are the times of easy, memorable passwords. I use <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to manage all my passwords.</p>
<p>Since I have no reason to believe that my private key has been compromised, I thought it might be time to change the password on the key.</p>
<p>To change the password on an ssh private key, use the ssh-keygen command, that you probably already used to create the key in the first place.</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code></pre>
<p>The lower-case p-param will ask ssh-keygen to change the passphrase of the file that is passed as an argument to -f.</p>
<p>On that account, I also changed the hostname in the public part of the key to reflect my current machine. Just edit ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in a text editor and change the hostname at the end of the key. It is just an identifier after all.</p>
