            <h1>About Moritz Grauel</h1>
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>my name is Moritz Grauel, or just Mo when you have trouble pronouncing it. I am a freelance software developer. I specialize on web and mobile development. While I don’t shy away from deep-down backend code, I prefer delighting my users with lovingly crafted, modern web apps brewed from state-of-the-art technologies and seasoned with a good dose of tasty user experience.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-blog">About this blog</h2>
<p>Well obviously the title is a lie. It <em>is</em> a blog. Or at least it is intended to be(come?) one. But since the domain also <em>is</em> a domain, this is somehow very consistent and teaches you an important lesson about this site: Don’t take anything you read here too serious! Please.</p>
<p>The topics, you are going to read here are wide and diverse but they all have something in common. They interest me to such a degree, that I felt the urge to write about them. Usually the posts should deal with stuff related to programming. Probably development. Sometimes tech in general. Or they might have something to do with some of my hobbies, like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27380123@N03/">photography</a>, cycling, bouldering… Whatever.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all views and opinions expressed in this blog are my own and do not represent in any way, shape or form the views or opinions of my current or any past employer.</p>
<p>If you don’t like what I write, that’s fine. Just go away. The internet is full of stuff. Find something you like.</p>
<p>Stay hungry, stay foolish…</p>
